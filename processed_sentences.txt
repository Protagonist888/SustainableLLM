project construction reference page in addition the broader area of east san jose did not have access to large scale public transportation based on us census data percent of the households along the project alignment entirety did not have private transportation and percent of the households had incomes below the poverty level lack of private transport which is highly correlate d with low household income is a strong indicator of transit dependency these individuals rely on transit not just for trips to and from work but for social medical and recreational travel access to the proposed high speed high capacity bart extension would allow individuals traveling through santa clara county much faster access to their destinations compared to travel on bus or light rail lines the project has the potential to substantially benefit the mobility needs of these special user groups reference purpose and need page while this study pertains t o the entire rail alignment it is indicative of the minority communities surrounding the berryessa transit center additionally santa clara county is the second worst region of the bay area for ozone and the worst for particulates mobile emissions are t he primary source of these and other air pollutants in the project area with steadily increasing travel it will become more difficult to substantially improve air quality congestion and slowing travel speeds tend to worsen the problem because there is a direct relationship between vehicle miles traveled vmt travel speed and air pollution adding to the list of pollutants are greenhouse gas emissions most of which have not been previously monitored as part of federal and state air quality regulatory programs these include carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and refrigerants with co contributing the most to the greenhouse effect emissions of co are large ly transportation related and proportional to vehicle miles of travel only by changing fue l types or reducing vmt will co emissions be reduced reference purpose and need page thus this project provides critical infrastructure transportation needs to a minority community and reduces vehicle miles traveled and consequently

of of of a conserving level of achievement for cr assess climate change vulnerability is described as follows in the performance improvement section of the envision guidance manual conserving the assessment of climate change impacts infrastructure vulnerability to climate change and how to incorporate climate change consid erations into infrastructure project delivery are still relatively new and unevenly applied concepts there is significant value in project teams sharing their knowledge and experience in order to facilitate incorporating climate change considerations into future projects as shown below during the first review the verifier determined the project met a superior level of achievement based on the cover sheet narrative and supporting documentation a superior level of achievement is described as follows superior resilience is best applied at a community level infrastructure is inherently connected to vast arrays of physical other infrastructure and nonphysical socioeconomic systems and the purpose of resilient infrastructure is to support the health safety and functions of the broader community as a whole the project team resubmitted this credit for the second review and ultimately received a conserving level of achievement first review analysis the following table includes the verif ier comments from the first review and if needed some explanation as to why the evaluation criterion were deemed met and how the submission might have been improved the verifier comment reflects the feedback provided to the project team while the explan ation provides additional context for this feedback criterion verifier comment explanation a met the project team relied on existing climate change studies conducted by the project owner bart the project team identified sea level rise downpour and flooding as the main threats to the project and its surroundings b met project team expanded the threats to include ozone depletion which was not mentioned in criterion a ozone depletion would technically be an atmospheric threat and therefore likely have an indirect impact on the project given the location in california rather than a review of key design variables or performance standards the project team identified strategies used to manage impacts as the crx resilience credits are structured the strategies should be reserved for discussion as part of cr establis h resilience goals and strategies however a verifier may concur that this criterion has been met based on information contained in the strategy documentation c met the project team could have extended its consideration of dependence on resources or s ervices to include interruption to energy or water and the potential impacts on the project d met the project team claims that ghg emissions is the most prevalent climate change threat to the community ghg emissions are an indirect impact not a direct climate change vulnerability the verifier should have requested more information on the interdepend encies between the project and community systems also the project team should have made a clear connection between the threats identified in criterion a and community systems vulnerabilities a chart or table may have been a useful way of conveying this information e not met this criterion needs to reflect the project team or owner publicly sharing their knowledge and experience on this project in order to facilitate incorporating climate change considerations into future projects also the policies listed in the supporting documentation do include climate threat findings the project team initially described how the owner published and shared the climate threat findings the verifier requested additional information on how climate threat findings are shared related to this specific project consider describing how lessons learned on this project are shared publicly as they relate to bart or vtas assessments from criterion a note from isi do not include links to web sites as supporting documentation pdfs of websites as provided in reference are acceptable second review analysis the following table includes the verifier comments from the second review and if needed explanations as to why the evaluation criteri on were deemed met and how the submission might have been improved only criteri on not met during the first review are evaluated during the second review the project team edited this credit to pursue a restor ative level of achievement for the second review as shown below the verifier determined the project met a conserving level of achievement based on the revised cover sheet and additional documentation provided for the second review criterion verifier com ment explanation verifier agrees a met b met c met d met e met verifier felt that vtas extensive public involvement during the creation of the environmental impact report ensured that the public was aware of the project impacts and the projects climate threats the eir was publicly released general comment s project teams need to f ocus their coversheet narratives on addressing the question asked and the numbered documentation guidance elements required to demonstrate a criterion is met if this is not addressed it should not be assumed that the verifier has been enough information to draw a conclusion on the appropriate level of achievement the project team did a great job of calling out supporting documentation in the coversheet narrative however it may have been more helpful if the project team used the same name as what is uploaded for the document rather than calling it reference reference etc in this case reference was called reference bart climate resiliency planning in the table of contents and uploaded to the application web portal as cr bart climate resiliency planning keep in mind that the verifier is reviewing hundreds of documents in a sh ort time and consistent naming will facilitate an easier review

level of achievement restorative superior restorative points earned of of of a restorative level of achievement for ql enhance public health and safety is described as follows in the performance improvement section of the envision guidance manual restorative projects provide relief or critical infrastructure services to communities experiencing or at risk of experiencing imminent negative health andor personal safety impacts this is where existing conditions have dropped below minimum standards for heal th or safety examples include communities where drinking water quality has reached unhealthy levels where bridges are at imminent risk of collapse or where critical infrastructure services are not available or no longer functioning as shown below during the first review the verifier determined the project met a superior level of achievement based on the cover sheet narrative and supporting documentation a superior level of achievement is described as follows superior health and safety im provements benefit not only the immediate surroundings but the broader community such as improving air quality and water quality providing access to walking and biking trails removing or repairing infrastructure at risk of failure and more the projec t team resubmitted this credit for the second review and ultimately received a restorative level of achievement first review analysis the following table includes the verifier comments from the first review and if needed some explanation as to why the evaluation criteri on were deemed met and how the submission might have been improved the verifier comment reflects the feedback provided to the project team while the explanation provides additional context for this feedback criterion verifier comment explanation a superior level of achievement has been met a met the submittal shows compliance with seismic design criteria conformance with ca air resources board off road diesel rule fire alarm requirements and bay area quality management district the narrative indicated compliance with osha standards and the verifier was able to reasonabl y surmise that these standards were met for the project additional d ocumentation to show that osha standards were met would have strengthened this submittal b met the submittal shows that the project incorporated walking and bike paths supporting improvements to the physical health of users and included a bike storage room and bike lockers which improve safety by providing an enclosed space and reducing theft these measures exceed minimum health an d safety requirement s although an index o f health and safety improvements is not included for as part of this criterion discussion the verifier determined sufficient health and safety improvements were identified throughout the credit submittal including waling and bike trails signage and air quality measures the discussion of air quality would be better suited for other credits c met the submittal shows that the project provides access to walking and biking trails and safety signage and measures at the road crossings for pedestrians and traffic entering and exiting the site these measures provide health and safety improvements to the immediate surroundings safety signage and announcements at the station for on coming trains station lighting safety signage at the bridge and bioretention basins and reduced co emissions due to tree planting are measures that would be better suited for discussion in other credits d met the submittal shows that the project incorporated walking and bike trails which supports improved physical health of users in the broader community the narrative claims that reduced vehicle use will improve air quality and result in improved heart and l ung health which would support this criterion the project team would need to provide criterion verifier comment explanation documentation showing the projects impact on vehicle use and the corresponding improvements to air quality and hea rt and lung health in order to support this claim and ensure its consideration for this criterion energy reduction and ghg emissions reduction measures are better suited to other credits e not met analysis of demographics impacted by the project and historical factors of equity and social justice within the project context is not provided it seems that some of this is discussed in ql regarding historically underserved east san jose residents the submittal states that the project entered into several agreements with the local communities and cities to ensure that no one community bears the risks and impacts of the berryessa transit center however these agreements were not provided documentation of demographics that consider historic factors of equity and social justice combined with a clear representation of the risks and impacts of the project would be necessary to support this criterion in addition any mitigation measures proportionately distributed to communities would need to be shown f not met a restorative level of achieveme nt is only available if project teams can demonstrate that the project provides relief or critical infrastructure services to communities experiencing or at risk of experiencing imminent negative health andor personal safety impacts please read descri ption of restorative on page of the manual the project team does not provide d ocumentation of how the community is currently experiencing or is at risk of experiencing health andor safety impacts the project must provide relief or critical infrastruc ture services to address conditions that have dropped below minimum standards of health or safety without an understanding of community health and safety risks or impacts it is unclear if the measures identified would contribute to this criterion secon d review analysis the following table includes the verifier comments from the second review and if needed explanations as to why the evaluation criteri on were deemed met and how the submission might have been improved only criteri on not met during the first review are evaluated during the second review the project team edited this credit to pursue a restorative level of achievement for the second review as shown below the verifier determined the project met a restorative level of achievement based on the revised cover sheet and additional documentation provided for the second review criterion verifier comment explanation verifier agrees a met b met c met d met e met environmental justice findings shows the project is bordered by minority communities and that the negative impacts are not disproportionate to these communities impact studies for displacement and relocation air quality electromagnetic fields hazards noise and vibration and transportation connectivity were conducted the analyses identified that impacts either will not occur or will be mitigated ensuring the effects to minority and lowincome communities will not be disproportionately high or adverse the discussion on stakeholder engagement and addressing community concerns is not necessary to meet the criterion federal transit administration record of decision reference pages is referenced in the coversheet narrative but is not provided as documentation however the criterion is sufficiently met based on the rest of the supporting documentation f met the revised submittal shows that the project addresses health and safety risks associated with the lack of mobility and connectivity to resources for low income populations lacking private transportation the revised submittal also shows the project is located in a region experiencing poor air quality due to ozone impacts and particulates which contribute to re spiratory problems the project will support decreased mobile emissions which will help address this negative health impact other elements of the project discussed in the coversheet narratives including minimizing disruption to traffic including a safety and emergency plan providing an emergency relief force and providing safety signage and lighting are specific to health and safety as a result of the project however the intent of this criterion is to address health or safety impacts that the commu nity is currently experiencing or at risk of experiencing therefore while relevant to other credits these elements do not factor into the assessment of this criterion general comment the project team did a great job of calling out supporting documentation in the coversheet narrative

impact with respect to compatibility with surrounding land uses and no mitigation is required design change eliminate south calaveras future station sta the feir and seir concluded that the south calaveras future station site would be compatible with surrounding uses because the proximity to residential commercial and office uses would be beneficial and allow for access to mass transit while no significant impacts were identified in the feir and seir the elimination of the south calaveras future station would eliminate any potential for impacts to surrounding land uses at this location

land use bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir wyeindustrial lead only optionwould be adjacent to the rail corridor row and within areas of existing commercial and industrial land uses the realignment of the milpitas wye under any of the three options would not introduce a new type of use to the area due to the proximity of the existing uprr tracks and existing wye just north of montague expressway thus the three alternative locations for the redesigned milpitas wye would not be incompatible with the surrounding land uses and no significant impact would occur no mitigation is required design change milpitas station sta the campus layout of milpitas station formerly the montaguecapitol station in the feir and seir was slightly modified however the footprint and campus

along new corridors to determine appropriate minimum levels of development around transit station consistent source circlepoint additionally surrounding commercial and office areas would become more easily accessible to residents customers and employees thereby establishing community cohesion thus the stations would promote rather than detract from the surrounding communities within the area the proposed milpitas and berryessa stations would be located in commercial office low density residential and industrial areas locating the bart stations in these areas achieves compatibility with existing surrounding uses for the following reasons proximate residential uses especially for lower income and fixed income residents would benefit by increased access to mass transit the presence of bart would broaden the availability of transit options and make people more mobile within the greater bay area see section transportation for analysis of traffic circulation effects nearby commercial uses would benefit because stores would become more easily accessible to a broader base of customers and more attractive destinations for shoppers proximate office uses would benefit by being more easily accessible to employees commuting options would make those offices more attractive to current as well as future employees thus the proposed milpitas and berryessa stations would support the existing land uses within the area and promote connectivity among the different types of land uses within the station areas and would not significantly impact or divide an existing community

which includes the alignment of the existing channel and creation of a more natural channel with a widened floodplain and riparian habitat th is restoration w ould enhance the hydrologic and geomorphic functions of the creek such as sediment transport and deposition fish and wildlife habitats natural water quality improvement and flood storage the project would improve fish passage for the federally and stat e listed central california coast steelhead oncorhynchus mykiss the proposed project would create a primary channel sized to convey the approximate annual flood a high flow channel to convey sediment and water during floods greater than the annual flood and a floodplain sized to convey the year recurrence interval flood construction of the upper penitencia creek improvement project will commence in the summer project components include the realignment restoration and enhancement of linear feet of upper penitencia creek the creation of approximately acres of seasonal floodplain wetlands and the restoration of approximately one acre of riparian habitat specifically the project includes the following features a portion of upper penitencia creek would be realigned to the southwest the total length of the realignment would be feet extending the linear length of the project reach by linear feet a secondary channel would be provided to accommodate high flows bioengineered bank treatment structures would be installed to secure the new creek configuration in place riffles and pools would be created for steelhead migration and resting approximately acres of seasonal wetlands would be created in the floodplain the stre amside floodplain and upland areas would be planted with native wetland and riparian vegetation new irrigation lines and electrical connections would be required to bring in potable water to the site to ensure plant establishment all existing outfall s would be reconstructed to connect to the new channel alignment p d rpt env rev o site conditions topography in the early s upper penitencia creek was permanently diverted to drain directly into coyote creek within a confined corridor as currently exists at the project site at the project site the upper penitencia creek watershed drains approximately square miles of which occur in the diablo range in a non urbanized canyon the remaining square miles of drainage area occur with the urban footprint of the coyote creek valley of which is underlain by alluvial fan deposits the project site is located at the far end of a relatively young alluvial fan at the transition with floodplain or bank levee deposits from coyote creek balance hydrologics the transition to urbanization in the upper penitencia creek watershed is abrupt and occurs at the doral drive crossing upper penitencia creek within the project site boundaries is a linear earthen channel with riprap or sackcrete armoring at several locations the creek is a narrow approximately to feet wide and shallow confined man made channel with minimal floodplain the existing channel runs approximately linear feet in distance over the project site other than the creek channel which is set to feet below the surrounding landscape the project site is relatively level with elevations ranging between to feet above mean sea level hydrology historically upper penitencia creek at the project site was likely an intermittent stream conveying streamflow for limited times during any given year during times of streamfl ow upper penitencia creek was a significant source of water for the local alluvial aquifer as surface flows percolated into the bed during times when the creek ran dry through the project site it likely moved large amounts of water just below its bed balance hydrologics beginning in approximately the s urbanization led to the construction of storm drainage infrastructure this drainage engineering and urbanization led to the conversion of upper penitencia creek in the vicinity of the p roject site from an ephemeral to a perennial stream this perennialization is likely due to a number of factors including the contribution of nuisance flows to the creek and flow releases and enhanced recharge of local alluvial aquifers associated with santa clara valley water districts water resource management activities jordan et al calculated a morphologic bankfull flow equivalent to c ubic feet second cfs near the project site defining bankfull in such a way that it corresponds to a year recurrence interval storm the acoe calculated a year flow typically used as a proxy for bankfull of approximately cfs at upper penitencia creeks confluence with coyote creek feet downstream of the project site based on these data balance hydrologics estimated that the year recurrent flood is equivalent to cfs additionally balance hydrologics conducted streamflow and sediment transport measurements at the project site during wy through wy the peak flows for each year were cfs cfs and cfs respectively p d rpt env rev o soils soils at the project site reflect the natural distal alluvial fan setting though they have been highly altered and disturbed by urbanization a large portion of the project site is c ompletely covered by impervious parking areas and buildings the areas within and immediately adjacent to the stream corridor along the railroad tracks and within several small landscaped areas are the only exceptions soils adjacent to the stream channe l are mapped as elder fine sandy loam helseth other soils on the project site are described as low slope urban land on alluvial fans borehole data gathered approximately feet downstream of the existing uprr bridge in the project area was use d to describe subsurface conditions these borehole logs indicate the existence of lean and potential fat clays down to approximately feet and deeper wang and parikh channel bank materials have been described for the project site and upstrea m reaches as gravels and cobbles near the base of banks grading to sand and silt deposits near the top of the bank profile jordan et al balance hydrologics existing vegetation dominant vegetation found within the

during the early portion of the rainy season prior to seed germination and root growth the tackifier will help prevent wind and wate r from removing the wood fiber and seed from the soil surface prior to seed germination the two hydroseed applications are summarized as follows first application seed mix and wood fiber lbsacre and compost ft acre second application wood fiber lbsacre and tackifier lbsacre container stock vta will be responsible for the acquisition of the container stock plants all plants will be propagated from native stock found within the santa clara valley plants will be installed in augured or hand excavated planting holes the planting hole for each container stock plant will be at least times the depth and times the width of the container the sides of the hole will be scarified prior to planting to remove smooth or glazed surfaces container stock plants will be placed in the planting holes so that the root collars remain slightly above final grade p d rpt env

inspected and any matted dead diseased broken twisted or circling roots will be pruned vertical cuts will be made on opposite sides of the container shaped rootball to deter root girdling a inch diameter by inch high watering basin will be constructed around all plants shredded bark or wood mulch will be appl ied to the planting basins all plants will be thoroughly watered following planting cuttings vta will be responsible for the collection of the required willow cuttings from sites in the santa clara valley if cuttings are used alternatively willow s pecies may be installed from container stock since there are very few collection sites in the urbanized upper penitencia creek watershed therefore a combination of the cuttings and container stock will likely be used collection sites for willow cuttings will be identified by a restoration ecologist prior to collection cuttings will be approximately feet long and tapered from a minimum of inch to a maximum of inch in diameter and cut at a right angle at the wide end of the cutting cuttin g materials will be harvested when the cuttings are dormant typically during fall and winter all cuttings will be hardened off green wood that is a maximum of year old growth cuttings will be installed the same day that they are collected and will be kept moist until they are planted cuttings will be installed with of their length below grade a inch diameter by inch high watering basin will be constructed around the plantings immediately after cutting installation the revegetation contractor will thoroughly water each cutting completely saturating the soil surrounding the cutting following installation each cutting will be will be thoroughly watered and the cutting will be checked for secure placement in the ground to facilitate gro wth plant establishment period and maintenance vta will be responsible for maintaining the planting area for the life of the monitoring effort ie five years to ensure that the plantings become established and the natural vegetative character of the creek corridor is maintained the plant establishment period pep will occur during the first three years following completion and final acceptance of the implementation of planting maintenance activities during the pep at a minimum will include plan t watering weed control removal of debris and removal of non native invasive species if they affect the viability of the plantings plant watering it is anticipated that irrigation will be applied to the planting area during the pep during the first year after planting irrigation will be applied weekly during the dry season in the second and third years following planting irrigation will be applied bimonthly or as needed based on the success of plantings the application method and rates will be determined during development of the planting plan the typical irrigation season will extend from april to p d rpt env rev o october however the irrigation schedule and application rates may be adjusted by the revegetation contractor depending on annual rainfall patterns the irrigation schedule and application rates may also be adjusted by the revegetation contractor as necessary during the pep based on plant performance and establishment weed control weed control will be provided on an as needed basis to r educe competition with the plantings during the entire year monitoring period weed control will include the control of invasive plants as defined in the california invasive plant councils invasive plant inventory cal ipc site evaluatio ns will be performed on a bi annual basis by a restoration ecologist to determine whether weed control is necessary weed control may include weed whacking outside plant basins hand pulling string trimming or herbicide treatments weed control activ ities will eradicate the majority of invasive plants in the planting areas if evidence exists that eradication would have a negative effect on native plant populations vta will consult with dfg and rwqcb to find an appropriate alternative plan t replacement during the entire year monitoring period any replacement plantings for woody vegetation that are required based on failure to meet success criteria will be provided by vta and installed by the revegetation contractor replacement will inc lude planting a sufficient number of plants or seedlings such that the total number of living plants meets or exceeds the performance standards replacement plants will be installed according to the original plant installation methods if in any year du ring the year monitoring period more than of woody plants require replacement vta will extend the monitoring period to ensure that new plantings are subject to five years of monitoring asbuilt drawings within days following the completion of construction and planting as built drawings will be prepared to document the post restoration condition of the site the drawings will be prepared in cad format following standard protocols and practices the as built drawings will depict the boundari es between existing habitat areas and the realigned area and will include documentation at scale sufficiently detailed to show the planting zones and typical spacing responsible parties vta will be the entity financially and otherwise for ensuring that all aspects of this mmp are implemented vta may assign this responsibility

management in order to ensure the long term success of the restoration effort it will be necessary to monitor the condition of the restoration site and potentially implement adaptive management monitoring protocol and s uccess criteria practices as the site develops toward a sustainable equilibrium condition the following sections provide details on each component of the monito ring and adaptive maintenance program and describe requirements for documentation and reporting during the five years following planting or until the time the established success criteria defined below are met monitoring and adaptive management will focus on evaluating the success of plant establishment in the revegetation area in addition any litter found on the restoration site will be removed during each monitoring visit and disposed of off site during the monitoring period monitoring will occur in the springearly summer of each calendar year april june to allow for a complete evaluation of the success of wetland features survivorship table summarizes the criteria that will be used to evaluate the survival of woody plantings and native grasses woody plant survival will be tallied for every individual surveyed along five transects randomly selected in year one measured as based on percent survival of all species groups combined as surveyed along five transects randomly selected in year one transects will be a minimum of feet in length and will be selected after plant installation by a qualified restoration ecologist transect monitoring will identify the dominant grass species and not e changes in the dominant grass species mix over the length of each transect table survival criteria for plantings upper penitencia creek improvement project site woody plantings year type of criterion used success criterion percent of plants surviving survival in good or fair condition survival in good or fair condition survival in good or fair condition survival in good or fair condition survival in good or fair condition adaptive management describes a resource management style that embodies change or modification adaptation in response to the outcome of previous management actions or to advances in scientific understanding under adaptive management management action is initiated results are monitored and subsequent management actions are adjusted for better outcome based on information collected during monitoring or other new data p d rpt env rev o plant survivorship will be monitored for a minimum of years after plant installation or until the success criterion has been met for consecutive years following cessation of irrigation health and vigor the condition vigor of surviving vegetation w ill be evaluated on the basis of internode length leaf color and leaf size as well as the presence of browse damage disease symptoms and insect infestation using the following qualifiers good condition plant has relatively long internode lengths and most or all leaves show healthy color and size andor of plants aboveground growth is affected by browse damage disease or insect infestation fair condition plant has medium to long internode lengths and most leaves show healthy color and size andor of plants aboveground growth is affected by browse damage disease or insect infestation poor condition plant has short internode lengths and few or some leaves show healthy color and size andor of plants aboveground growth is affected by browse damage disease or insect infestation natural recruitment natural recruitment will be monitored throughout the maintenance period the number of stems of native and non native woody plant species observed within the planting areas will be counted and reported by species along designated transects hydrologic and geomorphic monitoring hydrologic function and geomorphic evolution in the restored channel will be monitored several times each year during at least one major storm even t early in the season during at least one major mid season event and following each years storm season the principal focus of channel monitoring will be to assess whether restored or created channels are evolving in a healthy way toward a mature steady state this assessment will depend on regular qualitative observation and evaluation of changes in channel geomorphology and function channels are expected to evolve following re grading of the channel any of the following may represent cause for conc ern marked headcutting marked channel incision or downcutting substantial bank erosion or lateral channel migration excessive sedimentation or aggradation if these and other indicators of channel instability are absent channel function will be considered satisfactory the specific success criteria for the restored channel will be p d rpt env rev o sequential years with no or minimal adverse channel indicators headcutting incision excessive lateral migration etc however if any of the above conditions are observed site progress will be considered unsatisfactory other indications of channel instability or malfunction will also constitute unsatisfactory progress in this case additional restoration or channel stabilization measures may be needed to prevent adverse water quality impacts and degradation or loss of riparian and upland habitat if needed these measures would be selected designed and implemented by qualified personnel eg restorationfluvial geomorphologist pe ceg or chg with restor ation experience etc hydrologic monitoring of created floodplain wetlands during the year monitoring period will include regular visits during and immediately following the storm season following the first storm of the season wetlands will be monit ored monthly until the end of the storm season or until four sequential visits detect no ponded water or saturated soils hydrologic monitoring will document the extent depth and duration of ponding using a staff gage installed in the deepest portion of each floodplain wetland if ponding is absent soil saturation will be assessed hydrologic function of created floodplain wetlands will be considered satisfactory if ponding occurs and persists following rainfall events such that site soils remain saturated consistent with the intent of the design for each site note at a minimum soils should be inundated andor saturated for at least of the growing season and vegetation success criteria are met if the wetlands fail to meet these criteri a vta will work with the rwqcb to identify and implement remedial actions photographic documentation color photographic documentation of the revegetated areas will be conducted at the completion of the initial planting and once annually throughout the year monitoring period permanent photographic stations will be determined when the as built plans are developed stations will be located parallel to the stream no more than feet apart on each side of the stream and will present the full range of channel restoration and ripariangrassland plantings adaptive management all dead plantings identified during the plant establishment period will be replaced in the fallwinter immediately following monitoring vta will be responsible for identifying the appropriate species locations and ratios for replacement plantings based on the restoration ecologists assessment of the reasons for mortality and evaluation of the sites overall development replacement plantings will follow the procedures described for installation of plant material under plant procurement and installation in chapter the restoration ecologist and container plant availability will determine whether to use cuttings or container stock for replacement plantings depending on current conditions at the site after the first three years of monitoring and plant establishment no active maintenance is anticipated the planting areas would only be monitored in years and p d rpt env rev o data analysis data analysis will be conducted as soon as possi ble following collection of field data minimizing delays between data collection and analysis provides an opportunity to verify any discrepancies encountered in the original data set and to conduct further sampling as necessary before the site evolves s ignificantly data analysis will be conducted using standard spreadsheet database and statistical computer applications data input will be spot checked and the restoration ecologist or project manager will carefully review results the yearly monitor ing results will be compared with results from previous years to evaluate site progress plant survival the overall survival rate of woody plants and percent cover of native grasses will be compared to measurements in previous years and with the performan ce criteria survival rates will be based on the original number of woody plants installed and percent cover of native grasses in the seed mix annual monitoring results will be compared across years to evaluate revegetation progress percent survival w ill be calculated for each planted woody species surveyed in each of the five transects randomly selected in year one and for all woody species combined success for both woody species and native grasses will be predicated on two years of meeting survival criteria without irrigation percent cover will only be calculated for the overall species mix and not for each species health and vigor plant health and vigor will be reported as mean health and vigor of each species and the percentage of individuals who fall into the three general health and vigor categories good fair or poor condition health and vigor will be evaluated over time natural recruitment natural recruitment will be recorded each monitoring year on the basis of recruit

the liquefiable layer relative to the thickness of the overlying non liquefiable material ishihara suggests based on empirical observations from a number of japanese earthquakes that surface manifestation of liquefaction w ill not be significant if the site is relatively level the edges of the sand bodies are constrained so that lateral spreading towards a free face is prevented and the ratio of the thickness of the non liquefiable surface crust to the thickness of the liquefied underlying layer is greater than the boundary criteria provided ishihara a s the ground surface is relatively flat along the svsx and is typically not adjacent to large open cuts or free faces the potential for flow slide failures or lateral spreads is considered to be very low i n locations susceptible to liquefaction the primary liquefaction hazard would be seismic ally induced settlement and temporary increase in lateral earth pressures on below grade structures although a soil layer may or may not fully liquefy during an earthquake it can still experience settlement the bart facilities standards design criteria release facilit y design criteria structural foundations section limits the total settlements for trackway structure foundations to inch or less thus there would be a need to reduce the liquefaction related settlement hazard along some portions of the bart

memorandum february projects should be referred to the mitigation for liquefaction hazard in the following section potential liquefactionrelated uplift of buried structures d uring an earthquake an underground structure that is buoyant total weight less than the weight of the displaced soil and water and located in saturated liquefiable soil deposits may be susceptible to buoyant uplift if the soil liquefies fully a buoyant structure could float upward toward the ground surface a partly liquefied soil deposit would retain some of its initial shear strength and resist the uplift to some degree the tendency for upward displacement of buried structures such as the projects buried tunnels and stations would also depend upon the density and thickness of the overlying soil the increased pore pressure that is responsible for liquefaction could cause water and soil to migrate into the void beneath an uplifting structure thereby increasing the upward force deformation of the ground surface buildings and utilities located above an uplifted structure could be significant earthquake induced landslides the sv sx corridor is located on nearly flat terrain and is not identified on any california geological survey seismic hazard zone maps as being potentially susceptible to earthquake induced landslides therefore this potential hazard is considered very low and no measure w ill be

construction of t he station s a ccording to silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis additional analyses were conducted during preliminary engineering phase regarding potential surface settlements and lateral ground movements during construction of the bored tunnel and cut and cover stations for the silicon valley rapid transit project alternative the purposes of these analyses were to assess the magnitude and likelihood of settlement and ground movement physical damage to structures or utilities caused by potential settlement or ground movement and functional adverse effects related to any physical damage on performance of structures or utilities that may be caused by tunnel boring and cut and cover construction and to recommend appropriate mitigation measures b ased on the analyses the maximum surface settlement induced during tunnel boring along the tunnel alignment is predicted to be less than inch or in a range categorized as between negligible and slight minor crack ing that can easily be patched and sticking windows or doors would characterize slight damage any settlement would be distributed in a trough running parallel to and centered over the twin tunnel bores with the maximum settlement occurring at the cen terline of the trough between the two bores b ased upon the proximity of the new alignments to the original alignment and comparison of

february temporary excavation t he slope height inclination and temporary excavation depths should not exceed those specified in local state or federal safety regulations s trength softening sloughing and erosion could be expected for the bare surficial soil materials if the temporary slopes are exposed to weather and rain for an extended period of time stiff clays exposed from the excavation also tend to develop soil creep due to seasonal change in moisture content resulting in sloughing therefore adequate surface protecti on should be provided to protect the slope surface from erosion excessive drying andor saturation during construction a ll temporary excavations should be closely monitored during excavation to detect any evidence of instability soil creep settlements etc appropriate mitigation measures and a comprehensive monitoring plan should be implemented to correct such situations that may cause or lead to future damage to facilities utilities and other improvements e xcavation bottom instability may occur as a result of bottom heave piping or blow out bottom heave is typical for excavations in soft clays in granular soils bottom heave is normally not a problem however piping may be a concern if the force of the upward flow of water exceeds the buoyant weight of the soil at the excavation bottom blow out is another mode of failure where a pervious sand layer is located below he clay layer at excavation bottom and is not drained in advance blow out occurs when hydrostatic pressures at the base of the clay layer exceed the shear strength and weight of the clay plug based on the geology and available boring data soft to medium stiff clay and loose to medium dense sand may be encountered at the bottom of excavation for the box of the stations along t he svsx corridor section should be referred for the proposed mitigation measures shoring t he shoring system should be designed to relatively rigid and with as many supports or struts as necessary to prevent excessive straining and deformation of the supported soils this is also important with regard to existing asphalt concrete pavement of the nearby streets where tension cracking

there is a potential that ravelingflowing ground could occur before the sidewall supports are installed in which case continuous steel sheeting should be used continuous interlocking sheet pile is also recommended for relatively deep excavations below the groundwater level with concern of trench bottom stability t he sheeting should be driven to a sufficient depth below the excavation to prevent trench bottom instability bottom heave piping and blow out the required depth should be determined by the contractorshoring designer the type of driving equipment vibratory or impact hammers employed for sheet pile installation should be chosen and verified for drivability by the shoring contractor unconventional method of driving such as banging with backhoe bucket is not recommended h orizontal struts should be placed against both sides of the sheeting at regular depths as the walls are exposed in order to maintain continuous stability of the excavation bracing should also be installed as soon as practical against the continuous sidewall support failure to provide such strutsbracings in a timely manner may result in lateral creep which may cause damage to existing facilities removal of sheeting should be carried out in a manner that does not adversely affect any existing utilities andor any other improvements w hen using braced and sheeted trenches the inward lateral deflection which occurs as the excavation progresses must be considered local experience with similar subsurface soil conditions as well as published data indicates that settlement of the ground surface adjacent to the shoring is commonly on the order of to of the trench depth lateral movement of the same order of the magnitude should also be anticipated this assumes good workmanship and the preloading of struts by onward jacking against the excavation sides to reduce lateral movement for cut and cover construction surface settlement diminishes in magnitude with distance away from the shoring typically the zone of influence of the maximum settlement has been found to extend a distance of about times the excavation depth away from the shoring and then diminishes in magnitude gradually to zero at a horizontal distance of about to times the depth the maximum surface settlement adjacent to the open cut excavations during construction is predicted to be approximately inches

consists of stiff to very stiff leanfat clay underlain by interbedded layers of hard lean clay and dense to very dense sand it is our opinion that the maximum surface settlement adjacent to the open cut excavation during construction of these two alternate stations should be within the range of approximately inches estimated for the other stations analyses should be performed during subsequent engineering phases to confirm the estimated maximum surface settlement at these two stations i f existing utility lines are located within the potential zone of influence they could experience

fault w entworth et al delineated the silver creek fault as the western basement boundary of the evergreen basin in the fashion begun by taylor and chapman california department of water resources but using the current array of gravity stations and the basinthickness inversio n of gravity which sharpens the gravity depiction of the basin boundaries the western boundary of the basin is relatively straight and the principal issue in locating the fault is just how high on the steeply east dipping basin boundary in the gravity inversion to place the bedrock trace there is no convincing evidence for the location of the fault on the alluvial surface but two independent lines of evidence indicate that the trace lies at the top of the gravity boundary a steep gradient in an insar image ikehara and others galloway and others and marks an abrupt subsidence boundary with as much as cm of recoverable annual subsidence west of the silver creek fault that results from groundwater pumping this subsidence boundary requires a groundwater boundary in the waterbearing section which we take to mark the shallow expression of the silver creek fault independent confirmation of a basement bounding silver creek fault and its location is provided by the evergreen seismic reflection profile the eastward termination of the basement reflection at the silver creek fault in that profile occurs directly beneath the location of the insar boundary we thus place the bedrock trace of the silver creek fault along the top of the basin boundary in the gravity inversion extending northwestward from its intersection with the calaveras fault t he strongest evidence for any continued activity along the northern silver creek fault beneath the alluvial plain is recorded in the evergreen seismic reflection profile which was collected in by williams and others using a minivibroseis source the survey yielded reflections from depths of about m to km within the evergreen basin t he silver creek

we suggest that the fault has broken the shallow section and offset individual reflections by less than a cycle the reflections in the shallow section define distinct structural sag across the silver creek fault that near the surface is about m wide with amplitude of about m this amplitude decreases downward as does the width of the sag with the sag still distinct as deep as almost m the sag is evident as shallow as about m above which no coherent reflections were obtained the structural sag is marked by numerous steps and bends in the reflections of less than a cycle that imply small faults

faulta re typical of negative flower structures harding harding and others this is a simple example with poorly developed marginal faults that occurs above a straight single stranded fault having an earlier history of strike slip it is also a very shallow example less than about m developed in unconsolidated sediments wentworth and others take this flower structure to indicate continuing strike slip on the silver creek fault in the late quaternary equivalent reflections on either side of the flower structure are at about the same depth so during this younger period the fault would have experienced strike slip with cross fault extension but no dip slip wentworth and others estimated the age of the sediment at the shallowest imaging of the flower structure m by projecting stratigraphy downstream and parallel to the silver creek fault from well ccoc to the seismic profile this places the mdeep years old base of alluvial cycle at the shallowest expression of the flower structure which indicates that the synformal downward folding deformation is at least as young as about years wentworth and others suggest in the absence of good evidence to the contrary that the silver creek fault probably continues to absorb the kind of right slip that produced the negative flower structure but at so slow a rate that the shallow faulting diffused across the width of the flower structure is not evident at the ground surface which along the northern part of the fault is within an active depositional system in their summary discussion for silver creek fault silicon valley rapid transit

the available data show that faulting may extend through the quaternary sediments to a shallow depth possibly less than m therefore rupture on a potential shallow fault trace could affect the svrt tunnel although further evaluation of the buried fault trace is necessary to assess the location extent and recency of move ment on the fault it is possible to make a preliminary assessment of the extent of displacement that may occur during a potential earthquake on the silver creek fault the potential amount and distribution of fault displacement on an active fault can be e valuated using both a deterministic and a probabilistic approach in a deterministic approach the maximum displacement can be assessed based on observedmeasured coseismic displacements on the fault or based on the maximum size length magnitude of a potential earthquake occurring on the fault no reliable data on previous fault displacement or rupture length is available for the northern reach of the silver creek fault thus the potential displacement is estimated from the assessed maximum magnitude f or the fault the maximum magnitude is assessed to range from m to with a mean of m based on empirical relationships between moment magnitude m and surface fault displacement for strike slip earthquakes wells and coppersmith the ra nge of maximum displacements is estimated at to m to feet and the mean estimate is m feet for the mean maximum magnitude of m these estimates should be viewed as preliminary in nature pending further assessment of the fault source characteristics the potential displacement is assessed as predominantly strike slip but also may include a subordinate vertical component of slip further although the maximum displacement is assumed to occur on a single narrow fault trace width of less than several meters it is possible that the deformation could be accommodated over a wider zone on the order of several meters to s of meters with discrete displacements distributed on parallel fault traces in the zone of deformation a more detailed evaluation could consider several other factors that will affect the expected surface displacement at a specific site along the northern reach of the silver creek fault these include the likelihood that the maximum surface displacement along the rupture will occur at the tunnel crossing and possible effects of the thick quaternary sediments overlying bedrock on the amount and distribution of fault displacement during an earthquake considering these factors probabilistic andor deterministic fault displacement hazard levels can be defined for a potential fault crossing of the svrt tunnel alignment using a similar approach as that used for evaluating ground motion levels coppersmith and youngs youngs and others the displacement is estimated using empirical relationships between earthquake magnitude and maximum fault displacement such as wells and coppersmith and can be expressed as median th percentile and median plus log sigma th percentile displacements the displacement levels would be evaluated from a maximum credible earthquake for a deterministic assessment and from a probabilistic distribution of maximum magnitude based on a logic tree assessment of fault rupture parameters for the hayward fault to ev aluate the probability of exceeding specific amounts of fault displacement

recommendations for the proposed upper penitencia creek upc bridge as part of the bart silicon valley berryessa extension svbx project in san jose santa clara county california the purpose of this report is to evaluate the soil conditions with respect to the improvement being considered for this project based on the plans provided by the designer a new bridge structure is planned to provide vehicular access to the future bart berryessa station from berryessa road this structure is one of the early start items of the svbx project it is expected that the foundation construction within the creek will be completed during the first dry season in per the design criteria book of dated march th provided as part of the rfp documents the proposed structure is a vehicular bridge which will be designed based on caltrans bridge design specifications the proposed bridge structure will be a twospan precast bulbt girder structure approximately feet long and feet wide according to the preliminary engineering analysis and our discussions with the team concrete driven piles will be used for foundation support section subsurface condition reference boring data boring b br was drilled in the median of the berryessa road in the boring data was provided in the rfp package an additional boring boring was recently drilled in april the approximate locations of the borings are shown on the log of test borings in appendix a we have also reviewed the other boring data located along the existing railroad corridor b ber and b ber the locations of the borings are shown in plate no and the boring data are presented in plate no subsurface conditions boring b br was drilled in the median of berryessa road in the existing ground is at approximate elev feet the boring encountered about feet of firm to stiff lean clay overlying about feet of medium dense sand to about elev feet a thin layer of sandy lean clay was encountered from to feet deep below elev feet the boring encountered mostly lean clay to about elev feet feet below existing grade the maximum depth drilled with several sand layers at elev to feet and elev to feet groundwater was not measured or encountered due to the rotary wash drilling method during exploration boring was drilled to a maximum depth of feet in april located in front of the existing building berryessa road the existing ground elevation is at approximate elev feet the boring encountered predominantly lean clay with several clayey gravel lenses at elev to feet and elev to feet gravel particles were observed in the p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re samples and cuttings from drilling fluid below elev feet very dense silty sand was encountered at the bottom of the last sample at about elev feet the first feet of boring was advanced by hollow stem auger groundwater was encountered at about elev feet and the drilling was switched to rotary wash method at feet deep th e groundwater is consistent with our design assumption based on the nearby boring data along the existing railroad corridor the groundwater was assumed at elev feet for design purpose consequently groundwater should be anticipated during foundation construction due to the accelerated design schedule the design started in february and has been almost finished before the completion of boring we had conservatively assumed a uniform subsoil profile along the proposed location of the bridge structure based on boring b br to develop foundation recommendations since other boring data along the existing railroad suggest that the liquefaction potential is expected to be less severe toward south this has been discussed with the design team the new boring data has confirmed that our assumption was conservative and the design should be satisfactory section seismic design criteria the proposed bridge structure is designed per caltrans bridge design specifications the ground motion at the project site was determined based on the caltrans deterministic pga map and the caltrans ars online v the development of the design ars curve is based on several input parameters including site location longitudelatitude average shear wave velocity for the top m feet v sm and other site parameters such as fault characteristics site tofault distances the new design methods incorporate both deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazards to produce the design response spectrum the ars curve was developed based on boring b br prior to the completion of boring the boring data indicates that liquefaction potential is considered high consequently we have considered both liquefied case and nonliquefied case when developing the ars curve based on our calculation we have estimated v sm of ms and ms for liquefaction case and nonliquefaction case respectively according to the analysis results the recommended response spectrum for structure design is based on the data from usgs deaggregation hazard beta lower v sm yields higher spectral acceleration at longer periods and the higher v sm yields higher spectral accelerations at shorter periods the envelope of these two curves is recommended for design since the response spectrum is governed by the usgs deaggregation the governing fault was determined based on the deaggregation results at structural period of second p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re the site location and other relevant parameters are summarized as follows approx site location n w average v sm ms liquefied case ms nonliquefied case basin effect no near fault effect yes anticipated peak ground acceleration pga g the recommended response spectrum is the envelope of the two curves based on different v sm liquefied and nonliquefied cases which w as governed by the usgs deaggregation hazard beta governing fault north san andreas fault m max we have also calculated the v sm based on the boring the estimated v sm is about ms which is between the previous assumption where v sm are ms and ms for liquefaction case and nonliquefaction case respectively therefore the recommended ars curve is considered valid for the structural design section liquefaction potenti al liquefaction is a phenomenon in which saturated cohesionless soils are subject to a temporary but essentially total loss of shear strength under the reversing cyclic shear stresses associated with earthquake shaking submerged cohesionless sands and low plasticity silts of low relative density are the type of soils which usually are susceptible to liquefaction clays of medium to high plasticity are generally not susceptible to liquefaction the liquefaction potential was evaluated in accordance with the methods proposed by youd et al using the boring data as indicated by recent advances in soil liquefaction engineering bray for soils with sufficient fines content so as to separate the coarser particles and control behavior liquefaction appears to occur primarily in soils where these fines are either nonplastic or low plasticity silts andor silty clays pi and ll and with high water content relative to their ll w ll in general liquefaction hazards are most severe in the upper feet of the surface as mentioned in special publication a cgs in our opinion the impact due to the potential liquefiable soils below feet is considered relatively insignificant especially when the layer is relatively thin and discontinuous according to the seismic design criteria section we have adopted pga of g for analysis the analysis results indicate that the liquefaction potential is considered high at the abutment per boring b br for the recently drilled boring the liquefaction potential is considered low since the boring encountered primarily clayey materials with several thin layers of granular materials t he results of the liquefaction analyses are summarized as follows p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re table summary of liquefaction analysis results boring no soil layer depth ft sample depth ft soil type fines content ncs fs approx post liq settlement in bbr to spsm to sm to sp to sc to gc nonliq to sc nonliq to gc notes the postliquefaction settlement was estimated per ishihara and yoshimine fines contents estimated based on the soil description based on the analysis results the loose to medium dense sand encountered between and foot depths in boring b br may be subject to liquefaction during the design seismic event such medium dense sand was not as prominent from other boringscpts in the vicinity such variation is considered usual in the creek environment due to the historical meandering of the water body postliquefaction settlement from the liquefiable layers may be on the order of inches at abutment which was estimated per tokimatsu and seed down drag force is anticipated to be fully mobilized since the amount of movement is greater than inches per navfac dm ground rupture such as sand boiling and fissuring should not be an issue at the abutments because the nonliquefiable material above is about feet thick ishihara the blow count in the clayey sand layer at about elev feet is also low sample no this layer is relatively deep located more than feet below the existing grade according to the boring data the blow count may not be representative since part of the sampler was driven within the lean clay layer in addition the sample below sample no indicates that the sandy soils are relatively dense with an equivalent sptn of about also such formation was not encountered in other borings along the railroad corridor therefore in our opinion the impact due to liquefactioninduced down drag force should be insignificant when estimating axial pile capacity we have conservatively neglected the frictional contribution within this layer when considering liquefaction but additional down drag force was not considered above this layer for boring the blow counts of the clayey gravel layer encountered at to foot depths and to foot depths may not be representative since the samplers were advanced partially in clayey materials however the correlated n cs are still greater than which indicate low liquefaction potential for the clayey gravel encountered between and foot depths the factor of safety against liquefaction is less than unity however this layer is relatively deep and relatively thin in addition the correlated n cs is close to the impact due to liquefaction is neglected for foundation design p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re section foundations soil profile the generalized soil profile was developed

piles both concrete and steel piles and cast indrilledhole cidh piles the decision was made by ssh jv that caltrans standard concrete driven piles inch square class alt x will be used for foundation support per our discussion with the designer the elevation of the footing bottom is at elev feet for both abutments and elev feet for the bent the footings are placed below the potential scour elevations therefore the scour will not have impact on the foundation design the recommended minimum pile spacing is three times the pile diameter d to minimize the group effect for vertical pile capacities per caltrans standard design practice consistent with the current caltrans requirements the abutment foundations are evaluated for the foundation design data and loading conditions using working stress design wsd methods the foundation at bent is evaluated for the foundation design data and loading conditions using aashto lrfd bridge design specifications th edition with california amendments for the proposed structure pertinent foundation design information was provided by the designer including foundation design data and foundation design loads based on the load demand and

fhwa publication fhwa hi we have utilized computer program apile plus ensoft v for calculation purposes the calculations from other methods were also reviewed and compared it is our understanding that the piles at the abutments will be designed based on the service condition therefore liquefaction was not considered when estimating the pile capacity at abutment according to our analysis the estimated ultimate pile capacity for the piles at the abutment is about kips for the footlong piles when liquefaction occurs after a strong seismic event the factor of safety fs is about comparing to the provided service load of kips with an estimated down drag force of kips per pile as indicated in caltrans memo todesigner the total permissible settlement under the servicei limit state is generally limited to one inch for multispan structure with continuous spans for multicolumn bents the structural engineer has confirmed that this design criteria is considered reasonable consequently we have estimated the pile lengths based on the permissible settlement of inch the pile group settlement was estimated based on the loads provided by the designer and the dimension of the pile group according to the analysis results i t does not govern the pile design drivability analysis per grlweap program due to the presence of the granular materials drivability analysis was suggested by the reviewer to verify that whether the proposed concrete piles can be driven to the specified pile tip elevation the purpose of the drivability analysis is to estimate whether unsafe stresses will occur during installation and how many blows how much time it will take to install a pile we have performed drivability analyses based on the boring data from boring b br where the granular formation is more prominent computer program grlweap pdi was utilized for drivability analysis which is a onedimensional wave equation analysis program that simulates the pile response to pile driving equipment p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re for analysis purpose we have assumed a delmag d open end single acting diesel impact hammer with a maximum rated energy of about kft this hammer is commonly used in the bay area the hammer cushion consists of inch aluminum inch micarta and the pile cushion consists of inches of plywood per caltrans standard plan sheet b the concrete yield strength fc of the proposed inch square pcps concrete pile with concrete strength is psi the analysis results are shown in appendix c based on the analyses the maximum stress is below the commonly accepted threshold in construction practice the driving conditions appear reasonable and it is feasible to drive the planned concrete driven piles lateral pile design for lateral pile design geotechnical parameters for

concrete pile to account for lateral group effect at pile spacing of d a pmultiplier of was adopted effective for the py relationship in lpile analyses for nonliquefied soils it is recommend ed that the default values of k and e be used in lpile analyses ie the input fields be left as per discussi on with the designer the pile headcap connection is assumed to be free head condition for the abutments and fixed head condition for the bent since the abutments are designed based on service condition liquefaction was not considered and the pile head deflection was limited at about inch per caltrans memo to designer battered piles are planned at the abutments the lateral loads will mostly be resisted by the battered piles the lateral load on the vertical piles is expected to be relatively insignificant for strength limit state the nominal horizontal resistance is taken as equal to the applied horizontal load at which the structural capacity of the pile under the combined effect of bending and axial load or under shear whichever is smaller is reached and the resistance factor is for the strength limit state the design started in february and has been almost completed before drilling boring the design was based on the lpile analysis performed with the soil profile interpreted from boring b br which was the only available boring when the design started after the completion of boring we have conducted more analyses with new boring data from boring for bent and abutment to confirm the validity of the previous assumption the analysis results indicate that the design is considered consistent with the findings the lpile output data plots of deflection moment and shear along pile length are attached the selection of lateral pile capacity should be commensurate with the tolerable displacement in design consideration p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re lateral earth pressures for abutment wall design abutment retaining walls should be designed to resist the following applied lateral earth pressures and live load these values assume no hydrostatic pore pressure buildup behind the wall and are based on welldrained backfill behind the walls supported in native soil applied lateral earth pressure active condition pcf equivalent fluid pressure efp for the engineered backfill atrest condition pcf equivalent fluid pressure efp for the engineered backfill passive resistance ksf ultimate for seismic design of the abutment backwall feet high or greater for activated height less than feet modify proportionally ie h ksf a minimum lateral wall movement of of wall height to mobilize the full ultimate passive pressure is required cantilever walls which are free to rotate at least radian may be assumed flexible for the active condition walls that are not capable of this movement should be assumed rigid and designed for the atrest condition the effect of any surcharge dead live or traffic load should be added to the preceding lateral earth pressures a coefficient of and may be used to determine the additional earth pressure resulting from the surcharge for active and atrest conditions respectively section retaining walls retaining walls are planned on the east side of abutment according to the plans provided by the designer the wall is about feet long and the design wall heights are and feet with footing elevations at elev and feet respectively the retaining wall is designed by adopting caltrans standard retaining wall type according to the standard plan sheet b the standard walls are designed per lrfd approach under service limit state and strength limit state the extreme limit state which includes the earthquake loading is not considered consequently we have estimated a bearing capacity of ksf under strength limit state based on the subsurface condition and the footing elevations we have also checked the settlement based on the effective footing width b and the net bearing stress q under the service limit state as shown on the standard plan and the estimated settlement is less than inch for wall height up to feet therefore the service condition does not govern the design however liquefaction potential is considered high and postliquefaction settlement may be anticipated on the order of inches at the abutment based on boring b br according to the subsurface condition the medium dense sand is considered more prominent at this location based on the latest boring boring and other nearby p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re boringscpt along the railroad corridor the postliquefaction settlement should be expected random and localized see section based on the plans provided the footing is at elev feet for the foothigh wall which is relatively close to the liquefiable sand in addition this portion of the wall is immediately next to the abutment therefore pile foundation is recommended to reduce the impact due to the potential settlement after an earthquake event same as the bridge structure caltrans standard concrete driven piles inch square alt x will be used for foundation support with a design load of ki ps provided by the structural engineer ie nominal load of kips the recommended minimum pile spacing is three times the pile diameter d to minimize the group effect for vertical pile capacities the recommended pile tip elevations are summarized in the following pile data table table pile data table for retaining wall location pile type nominal resistance design tip elev specified tip elev compression tension retaining wall abut class alt x kips a note design tip elevations are controlled by a compression l oad the pile capacities were estimated based on procedures per tomlinson as quoted in fhwa publication fhwa hi we have utilized computer program apile plus ensoft v for calculation purposes as mentioned above the earthquake loading was not considered for the wall design per the standard plan similar to the abutment design liquefaction was not considered when estimating the pile capacity the estimated pile length is feet long based on a nominal design load of kips provided by the designer during a seismic event when liquefaction occurs the ultimate pile capacity is estimated about kips for the footlong piles the fs is about comparing to the service load of kips with an estimated down drag force of kips per pile section slope stability due to the presence of liquefiable soils at abutment the stability of the creek bank was evaluated under three different scenarios static condition seismic condition pseudo static with a seismic coefficient k and postliquefaction condition shortterm undrained shear strength nonliquefied parameters were used for seismic condition since liquefaction generally is not expected to occur in conjunction with the peak ground acceleration duncan wright residual shear strengths sr were adopted only for the postliquefaction condition without seismic coefficient the residual shear strengths were estimated per kramer wang which is a function of n and the effective overburden p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n re for the seismic coefficient k we have referenced to caltrans guidelines guidelines for structures foundation reports manual ver which recommends that the seismic factor equal to one third of the horizontal peak acceleration and not exceeding g according to the ars curve an average pga of g was assumed for design at the project site therefore a seismic coefficient k of g was used for pseudostatic analysis stability analyses were conducted at abutment which is considered more representative the analysis results are summarized in the following table table summary of slope stability analysis location factor of safety static condition pseudo static analysis kg post liquefaction with residual shear strength abutment based on our analysis the stability of the final configuration of the creek banks and the abutment appears to be satisfactory the potential of lateral spreading is considered low and it should not have impact on the proposed structure section corrosion corrosion test was performed on a selected sample from boring that was recently drilled but no corrosion test was conducted on samples collected from boring b br we have also referred to the test results along the existing railroad corridor at the planned

of the pile drag load is a matter for the pile structural strength and the main ques tion is if there is settlement that can cause downd rag fellenius outlines three criteria to check a dead plus live lo ad must be smaller than the pile capacity divided by an appropriate factor of safety b dead load plus the drag load must be smaller than the structural strength divided by an appropriate factor of

pile design considering the potential drag loads present at abutment n f wang a a the down drag load for the piles at abutment will be induced by the soil above the liquefiable layer moving downwards due to postliquefaction settlement therefore the neutral plane np will be within the liquefied layer under this circumstance we have combined the down drag load with the service load as the demand to

res olution no a resolution of the board of directors of the santa clara valley transportatio n authority declaring a climate emergency whereas according to the world meteorological association the last years were the hottest years on record and the warmest years on record have occurred within the past years whereas global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide the primary heattrapping or greenhouse gas have increased by percent since preindustrial times from parts per million to parts per million primarily due to human activities including burning fossil fuels and deforestation are rising at a rate of to parts per million annually and must be reduced to not more than parts per million and likely lower if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted according to former national aeronautics and space administration climatologist dr james hansen whereas global atmospheric concentrations of other greenhouse gases including methane nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons have also increased substantially since preindustrial times primarily due to human activities including burning fossil fuels whereas current climate science and realworld observations of climate change impacts including ocean warming ocean acidification floods droughts wildfires and extreme weather demonstrate that a global rise in temperatures of degree celsius above preindustrial levels is already having dangerous impacts on human populations and the environment whereas the national climate assessment found that climate change due to global warming has caused and is expected to cause additional substantial interference with and growing losses to infrastructure property industry recreation natural resources agricultural systems human health and safety and quality of life in the united states whereas the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has determined that climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather and other climaterelated disasters including drought wildfire and storms that include precipitation whereas climaterelated natural disasters have increased exponentially over the past decade costing the united states more than double the longterm average during the period of through with total costs of natural disasters during that period of approximately billion per year whereas the centers for disease control and prevention has found wideranging acute and fatal public health consequences from climate change that impact communities across the united states a whereas the national climate and health assessment of the united states global change research program identified climate change as a significant threat to the health of the people of the united states leading to increased temperaturerelated deaths and illnesses air quality impacts extreme weather events numbers of vectorborne diseases waterborne illnesses food safety nutrition and distribution complications and mental health and wellbeing concerns whereas the consequences of climate change already disproportionately impact frontline communities and endanger populations made especially vulnerable by existing exposure to extreme weather events such as children the elderly and individuals with preexisting disabilities and health conditions whereas individuals and families on the frontlines of climate change across the united states including territories living with income inequality and poverty institutional racism inequity on the basis of gender and sexual orientation poor infrastructure and lack of access to health care housing clean water and food security are often in close proximity to environmental stressors or sources of pollution particularly communities of color indigenous communities and lowincome communities which experience outsized risk because of the close proximity of the community to environmental hazards and stressors in addition to collocation with waste and other sources of pollution are often the first exposed to the impacts of climate change and have the fewest resources to mitigate those impacts or to relocate which will exacerbate preexisting challenges whereas in the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change projected that the earth could warm degrees celsius above preindustrial levels as early as whereas the climatic changes resulting from global warming above degrees celsius above preindustrial levels including changes resulting from global warming of more than degrees celsius above preindustrial levels are projected to result in irreversible catastrophic changes to public health livelihoods quality oflife food security water supplies human security and economic growth whereas in the united nations intergovernmental sciencepolicy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services found that humaninduced climate change is pushing the planet toward the sixth mass species extinction which threatens the food security water supply and wellbeing of billions of people whereas according to climate scientists limiting global warming to not more than degrees celsius above preindustrial levels and likely lower is most likely to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change whereas even with global warming up to degrees celsius above preindustrial levels the planet is projected to experience a significant rise in sea levels extraordinary loss of biodiversity intensifying droughts prodigious floods devastating wildfires and other extreme weather events resolution a whereas according to climate scientists addressing the climate emergency will require an economically just and managed phaseout of the use of oil gas and coal to keep fossil fuels in the ground whereas the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change has determined that limiting warming through emissions reduction and carbon sequestration will require rapid and immediate acceleration and proliferation of farreaching multilevel and crosssectoral climate mitigation and transitions in energy land urban and rural infrastructure including transport and buildings and industrial systems whereas massive comprehensive and urgent governmental action is required immediately to achieve the transitions of those systems in response to the severe existing and projected economic social public health and national security threats posed by the climate crisis whereas the massive scope and scale of action necessary to stabilize the climate will require unprecedented levels of public awareness engagement and deliberation to develop and implement effective just and equitable policies to address the climate crisis whereas on september governor newsom issued executive order n which called on the entire state government of california to redouble its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change while building a stable inclusive economy whereas a number of local jurisdictions and governments in the united states and across the world have already declared a climate emergency and a number of state and local governments are considering declaring a climate emergency in response to the massive challenges posed by the climate crisis now therefore be it resolved by the santa clara valley transportation authority board of directors that global climate change caused by human activities has resulted in a climate emergency which demands mobilization at a massive scale to halt reverse mitigate and prepare for the consequences of the climate emergency and to restore the climate for future generations vt a staff will evaluate administrative procedures to incorporate the consideration of climate change impacts for all relevant proposed policies programs or actions approved by the board of directors vt a will identify specific metrics including objectives and targets to prioritize opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop a climate action plan to guide its climate emergency response vta will support legislative efforts to avert climate change by federal state

bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir greenhouse gas emissions introduction the feir and seir considered greenhouse gas ghg emissions within section of each document the feir described the sources of ghgs and the effect of ghg emissions on the atmosphere the seir concluded that the feir information remained accurate and did not update the ghg discussion since publication of the seir the bay area air quality management district baaqmd has published new guidance for assessing climate change and ghg emissions in environmental documents the new guidance includes a summary of recent regulations and a quantitative threshold for assessing impac ts baaqmd california environmental quality act air quality guidelines june additionally the ceqa guidelines have been amended to require an evaluation of ghg emissions updates to the ceqa guidelines codified in march require lead agencies to consider the potential for a project to result in significant emissions of ghgs the updated ceqa guidelines further state that one of the factors that lead agencies should consider in determining the significance of a projects ghg emissions is whether the projects anticipated emissions would comply with pertinent regulations thus this section includes a comprehensive discussion of ghg regulations and ghg emission impacts this section serves as a stand alone technical section that entirely replaces the ghg discussions in both the feir and seir environmental settin g unlike emissions of criteria and toxic air pollutants which have local or regional impacts emissions of ghgs that contribute to global warming or global climate change have a broader global impact global warming is a process whereby ghgs accumulating in the atmosphere contribute to an increase in the temperature of the earths atmosphere the principal ghgs contributing to global warming are carbon dioxide co methane ch nitrous oxide n o and fluorinated compounds these gases allow visible and ultraviolet light from the sun to pass through the atmosphere but they prevent heat from escaping back into space among the potential implications of global warming are rising sea levels and adverse effects to water supply water quality agriculture forestry and habitats in addition global warming may increase electricity demand for cooling decrease the availability of hydroelectric power and affect regional air quality and public health like most criteria and toxic air pollutants much of the ghg production comes from motor vehicles environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir in addition to co ch and n o ghgs include hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs sulfur hexafluoride sf and water vapor of all the ghgs co is the most abundant pollutant that contributes to climate change through fossil fuel combustion co accounts for approximately percent of the total ghg emissions in california in addition a number of human made pollutants such as carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides non methane volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide so have indirect effects on terrestrial or solar radiation absorption by influencing the formation or destruction of other climate change emissions carbon dioxide equivalent co e is a measurement used to account for the fact that different ghgs have different potential to retain infrared radiation in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect this potential known as the global warming potential of a ghg is dependent on the lifetime or persistence of the gas molecule in the atmosphere for example ton of ch has the same contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately tons of co and ton of no has the same contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately tons of co therefore ch and n o are much more potent ghg s than co expressing emissions in co e takes into consideration the contributions of all ghg emissions to the greenhouse effect regulatory setting federal greenhouse gas regulations supreme court ruling the united states environmental protection agency usepa is the f ederal agency responsible for implementing the clean air act caa in april the us supreme court ruled that co is an air pollutan t as defined under the caa and that the usepa has the authority to regulate emissions of ghgs us supreme court massachusetts et al v environmental protection agency et al us april epa actions in response to the mounting issue of climate change the usepa has taken actions to regulate monitor and potentially reduce ghg emissions mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on september the usepa issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of ghgs from large ghg emissions sources in the united states in general this national reporting requirement will provide the usepa with accurate and timely ghg emissions data from facilities that emit metric tons or more of environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir co per year this publically available data will allow reporters to track their own emissions compare them to similar facilities and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future reporting is generally at the facility level however certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases along with vehicle and engine manufacturers will report at the corporate level an estimated percent of total us ghg emissions from approximately facilities is covered by this final rule proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under the clean air act in april the usepa published its endan germent finding in the federal register the endangerment finding is based on section a of the caa which states that the a dministrator of the usepa should regulate and develop standards for emissions of air pollution from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines which in its judgment cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare the proposed rule addresses section a in two distinct findings the first addresses whether or not the concentrations of the six key ghgs ie co ch no hfcs pfcs and sf in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the second addresses whether or not the combined emissions of ghgs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to atmospheric concentrations of ghgs and therefore the threat of climate change usepa proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under the climate change act april the administr ator proposed the finding that atmospheric concentrations of ghgs endanger the public health and welfare within the meaning of section a of the climate change act the evidence supporting this finding consists of human activity resulting in high atm ospheric levels of ghg emissions which are very likely responsible for increases in average temperatures and other climatic changes furthermore the observed and projected results of climate change eg higher likelihood of heat waves wild fires droughts sea level rise and higher intensity storms are a threat to the public health and welfare therefore ghgs were found to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations the administrator also proposed the finding that ghg emissions from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution which is endangering public health and welfare the proposed finding cites that in motor vehicles were the second largest contributor to domestic ghg emissions percent of total behind electricity generation and that in the us was environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir responsible for percent of global ghg emissions therefore ghg emissions from motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines were found to contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare state greenhouse gas regulations assembly bill in then governor gray davis signed assembly bill ab ab requires that the california air resources board c arb develop and adopt by january regulations that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light duty trucks and other vehicles determined by the california air resources board to be vehicles whose primary use is noncommercial personal transportation in the state to meet the requirements of ab in c arb approved amendments to the california code of regulations ccr adding ghg emissions standards to californias existing standards for motor vehicle emissions amendments to ccr title sections and ccr and adoption of section ccr require automobile manufacturers to meet fleet average ghg emissions limits for all passenger cars light duty trucks within various weight criteria and medium duty passenger vehicle weight classes ie any medium duty vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating less than pounds that is designed primarily for the transportation of persons beginning with the model yea r for passenger cars and light duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight lvw of pounds or less the ghg emission limits for the model year are approximately percent lower than the limits for the first year of the regulations the model year for light duty trucks wi th a lvw of pounds to gross vehicle weight of pounds as well as medium duty passenger vehicles ghg emissions would be reduced approximately percent between and in december a group of car dealerships automobile manufacturers and trade groups representing automobile manufacturers filed suit against ca rb to prevent enforcement of ccr sections and as amended by ab and ccr the automakers suit asserted that californias implementation of regulations that in effect regulate vehicle fuel economy violates various federal laws regulations and policies us district court for the eastern district of california central valley chrysler jeep et al v catherine e witherspoon in her official capacity as executive director of the california air resources board et al december on december the court found that if california receives appropriate authorization from the usepa the last remaining factor in enforcing the standard these regulations would be consistent with and have the force of environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir federal law thus rejecting the automakers claim this authorization to implement more stringent standards in california was requested in the form of a caa section subsection b waiver in since that time the usepa failed to act on granting california authorization to implement the standards and governor schwarzenegger and attorney general edmund g brown filed suit agains t the usepa for the delay in december us epa administrator stephen johnson denied californias request for the waiver to implement ab in his denial johnson cited the need for a national approach to reducing ghg emissions the lack of a need to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions and the emissions reductions that would be achieved through the energy independence and security act of the state of california filed suit against the usepa for its decision to deny the caa waiver the recent change in presidential administration directed the usepa to reexamine its position for denial of californias caa waiver and for its past opposition to ghg emissions regulation california received the waiver notwithstanding the previous denia l by the usepa on june assembly bill california global warming solutions act in september governor schwarzenegger signed ab chapter statutes of the california global warming solutions act of which enacted sections of the california health and safety code ab requires the reduction of state wide ghg emissions to levels by this amounts to approximately a percent reduction compared to existing state wide ghg emission levels or a percent reduction from projected business as usual emission levels the required reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable state wide cap on ghg emissions beginning in to effectively implement the state wide cap on ghg emissions ab directs carb to develop and implement regulations that reduce state wide ghg emissions generated by stationary sources specific actions required of c arb under ab include adopting a quantified cap on ghg emissions that represent s emissions levels and disclosing how the cap is quantified institutin g a schedule to meet the emissions cap and develop ing tracking reporting and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that california achieves the necessary reductions in ghg emissions to meet the cap in addition ab states that if any regulations established under ab cannot be implemented c arb is required to develop additional regulations to control ghg emissions from vehicles as part of ab environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir in december c arb adopted its climate change scoping plan scoping plan the scoping plan outlines the primary strategies that the state will implement to achieve an approximately million metric ton mmt reduction in co e or an approximately percent reduction from the stat es projected co e emission level of mmt under a business asusual scenario ie a reduction of mmt co enearly percent from to average emissions carb the scoping plan includes carb recommended ghg reductions for each emissions sector of the state s ghg inventory the scoping p lan calls for the largest reductions in ghg emissions to be achieved by implementing the following measures and standards improved emissions standards for light duty vehicles estimated co e reduction of mmt t he low carbon fuel standard estimated co e reduction of mmt e nergy efficiency measures in buildings and appliances and the widespread development of combined heat and power systems estimated co e reduction of mmt and a renewable portfolio standard for electricity production estimated co e reduction of mmt carb has not yet determined what amount of ghg reductions it recommends from local government operations however the scoping plan states that land use planning and urban growth decisions will play an important role in the states ghg reductions because local governments have primary authority to plan zone approve and permit how land is developed to accommodate population growth and the changing needs of their jurisdictions meanwhile carb is also developing an additional protocol for community emissions carb further acknowledges that decisions on how land is used will have large impacts on the ghg emissions that will result from the transportation housing industry forestry water agriculture electricity and natural gas emission sectors the scoping plan states that the ultimate ghg reduction assignment to local government operations is to be determined with regard to land use planning the scoping plan predicts a co e reduction of approximately mmt associated with implementation of sb as discussed below carb

allocation as part of the alignment sb requires m etropolitan planning organizations mpos to adopt a sustainable communities strategy scs or alternative planning strategy aps that prescribes land use allocation in that mpos regional transportation plan rtp carb in consultat ion with the mpos is required to provide each affected region with reduction targets for ghgs emitted by passenger cars and light trucks in the region for and these reduction targets will be updated every eight years but can be updated every four years if advancements in emissions technologies affect t he reduction strategies to achieve the targets carb is also charged with reviewing each mpos scs or aps for consistency with its assigned ghg emission reduction targets if an mpo does not meet its ghg reduction target transportation projects located with in its boundaries would not be eligible for funding programmed after january this bill also extends the minimum time period for the r egional housing needs

provisions of ceqa executive order s executive order s signed by governor schwarzenegger on june proclaimed that california is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change the order declared that increased temperatures could reduce snowpack in the sierra nevada mountains further exacerbate californias air quality problems and potentially cause a rise in sea levels to combat those concerns the order established targets for total ghg emissions which include reducing ghg emissions to the level by to the level by and to percent below the level by the executive order also directed the secretary of the california environmental protection agency cal epa to coordinate a multi agency effort to reduce ghg emissions to the target levels the secretary is to submit biannual reports to the governor and legislature on the pr ogress toward reaching the emission targets the impacts of global warming on californias resources and mitigation and adaptation plans to combat impacts of global warming environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir to comply with the executive order the cal epa secretary created the california climate action team which is composed of members from various state agencies and commissions in march the california climate action team released its first report which proposed achieving the ghg emissions targets by building on voluntary actions of california businesses and actions by local governments and communities along with continued implementation of state incentive and regulatory programs executive order s on november governor schwarzenegger signed executive order s which directs california to develop methods for adapting to climate change through preparation of a state wide plan the executive order directed the opr in cooperation with the cra to provide land use planning guidance related to sea level rise and other climate change impacts by may the order also directed the cra to develop a state climate adaptation strategy by june and to convene an independent panel to complete the first california sea level rise assessment r eport the public comment period on the state climate adaptation strategy closed september and the report was made public december the assessment report is required to be completed by december and to address the following four items project the relative sea level rise

selected sea level rise projections synthesize existing information on projected sea level rise impacts to state infrastructure eg roads public facilities beaches natural areas and coastal and marine ecosystems discuss future research needs relating to s ea level rise in california executive order s in governor schwarzenegger signed executive order s which proclaimed the transportation sector as the main source accounting for over percent of ghg emissions in california the execut ive order also established a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in california by a minimum of percent by in particular the order established a lowcarbon fuel standard lcfs and directed the secretary for environmental protection to coordinate the actions of the cec c arb the university of california and other agencies to develop and propose protocols for measuring the lifecycle carbon intensity of transportation fuels this analysis supporting development of the

agroforestry carbon sequestration rates green earth appeal httpsgreenearthappealorgcoverification agroforestry carbon sequestration rates executive summary at the green earth appeal we are planting trees in tropical climates along with the provision of tools education and infrastructure to provide aidreliant communities with sustainable and profitable agroforestry farming businesses now and for generations to come as well as helping end poverty the trees we plant have another significant benefit to our planet through the process of photosynthesis trees absorb co and push it down through their root system where it remains harmless beneath the groundin summary whilst the carbon sequestration rates are lower in cooler climates in the projects that green earth appeal funds research and evidence demonstrates that in a tropical climate a tree will sequester a minimum of around kg of co per year for a useful life span of years ie kg per tree planted in its year useful lifetime carbon sequestration by burning fossil fuels and destroying forests we are releasing dangerous and harmful greenhouse gases importantly carbon dioxide co into the atmosphere these heattrapping gases are warming the planet resulting in changes that are taking us outside the climate bounds within which civilisation as we know it developed last year a report by the une found that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed parts per million ppm its highest level since the pliocene epoch million years ago human activities in the meanwhile fromthese carbonsensitive farming and land management practices can produce a huge increase in the number of tons of carbon sequestered per year while also improving fertility raising food output and reducing soil erosion further research into sequestration rates was carried out by dexter dombro ceo of amazonia reforestation his studies backed up by science daily state that natural african tropical forests absorb approximately kg lbs of carbon per hectare per year if you take kg by times more wood per hectare in a plantation setting the result is kg lbs per hectare per year divided home united nations how we help where we help apply for grant contact agroforestry carbon sequestration rates green earth appeal httpsgreenearthappealorgcoverification driving fossil fuel burning cars to burning coal are increasing this ppm by roughly ppm a year studies over the last thirty years have shown variance in the amount of carbon that trees sequester however recently environmental analyst lester r brown the man considered one of the great pioneer environmentalists studied this field in depth and realised sustainable development and in particular reforestation and afforestation in his book time for plan lester r brown founder of the world watch institute and former president of the earth policy institute said that whilst deforestation has already been banned in some areas to moderate flooding stabilize soils and prevent erosion the worlds remaining forests store massive amounts of carbon therefore the need for forest protection now goes beyond that of local environmental protection to global climate protection his research showed that a newly planted tree in the tropics can remove up to kilograms of co from the atmosphere each year during its growth period of years on the other hand a tree in the temperate regions can take in kilograms additional carbon can be sequestered through improved agricultural land management this includes expanding the area of minimum or notill cropland planting more cover crops during the offseason and using more perennials instead of annuals in cropping patternsby plantation trees per hectare which results in an average of kg lbs of carbon sequestered per tree per year another study carried out by myers and goreau showed that tropical tree plantations of pine and eucalyptus can sequester an average of tons of carbon per hectare per year therefore the plantation can sequester an average of lbs lbs cohayear or taking an average of trees per hectare kg or lbs cotreeyear the amount of co a tree sequesters varies based on the growth rate age and species of the particular tree young quickly growing trees uptake significantly more carbon than mature trees with a slower growth rate warm and wet climates with long growing seasons also contribute to rapid plant growth and indirectly promote higher rates of carbon sequestration the age of the forest plays a role as well a recent study in found that new rainforests grown on land considered to be degraded known as secondary forests are capable of storing up to times more carbon than oldgrowth rainforests where tree growth has largely plateaued this is backed up by a report by the fao conclusion in summary whilst the carbon sequestration rates are lower in cooler climates in the projects that green earth appeal funds research and evidence from the une the fao and scientists and environmentalist from around the globe all point to the fact that in a tropical climate a tree will sequester a minimum of around kg of co per year for a useful life span of years ie kg per tree planted in its year useful

adaptation pilot study executive summary introduction chapter the nine county san francisco bay area home to approximately million people is the nations fifth most populated metropolitan or urbanized area its economy culture and landscapesupporting prosperous businesses vibrant neighborhoods and productive ecosystems are linked with a vital system of public infrastructure including freeways seaports and airports railroads local roads mass transit and bicycle and pedestrian facilities that connect the shoreline communities to each other and to the rest of the region the state the nation and the world according to current projections national research council climate change could cause the bay to rise by to inches by midcentury and by to inches by the end of the century this means that todays floods will be the futures high tides and areas that currently flood every years will flood much more frequently neighborhoods businesses and entire industries that currently exist on the shoreline will be subject to this flooding and the many other direct impacts that will result from it these shoreline areas in the bay are home to more than residents who will be directly affected and many others including workers who will be indirectly affected by reduced access to important services such as transit and commercial centers health care facilities and schools given the complexity of the shoreline and its management it is essential to start to develop adaptation strategies now to protect the prosperity of the bay area and its inhabitants in the future the metropolitan transportation commission mtc the san francisco bay conservation and development commission bcdc the california department of transportation district caltrans and san francisco bay area rapid transit distr ict bart have partnered on a collaborative sub regional pilot project to assess adaptation options for a subset of key transportation assets vul nerable to sea level rise slr in alameda county this study builds on the adapting to rising tides transportation vulnerability and risk assessment pilot project which was completed in and identified representative critical transportation assets vulnerable to sea level rise slr both projects were funded by the federal highway administration fhwa the first study developed detailed risk profiles for approximately transportation assets including road rail and transit having identified the risks and in order to move from assessment to action three focus areas within alameda county containing core transportation assets and adjacent community assets were selected for further study to ensure a thorough understanding of their vulnerabilities once that enhanced vulnerability had been assessed a set of detailed representative adaptation strat egies ha ve been developed as potential solutions to protect key bridge highway transit and community assets from future inundation project goals the detailed project goals were to develop a refined understanding of vulnerability and risk for the core transportation assets in three focus areas within the alameda county sub region a refined understanding of slr and storm event exposure in the three focus areas by analyzing the extent depth and pathways of inundation caused by overtopping of specific sh oreline segments highlevel climate adaptation options on three scales the core transportation assets alone the core transportation assets with key adjacent assets and each focus area as a whole adapting to rising tides transportation vulnerability and risk assessment pilot project te chnical report november httpwwwmtccagovplanningclimaterisingtides technicalreportpdf ibid mtc climate adaptation pilot study es five refined representative adaptation options with specific and detailed actions including identification of timing responsible parties and methods for implementation a suite of criteria used first to select representative adaptation strategies from the long list and then second to evaluate the high level climate adaptation strategies selected for further development three focus areas three focus areas were selected for study within alameda county based on their vulnerability and risk as identified in the previous study the san francisco oakland bay bridge peninsula bay bridge touchdown focus area the oakland coliseum area coliseum focus area the state route corridor hayward focus area the three focus areas include a confluence of major regional transportation assets and are interwoven with other important regional and community assets the transportation infrastructure in the three focus areas includes assets critical to the regions mobility and economy such as multimodal hubs i i state route sr two critical bridges the san francisco oakland bay bridge i and the san mateo hayward bridge sr arterial and collector streets bart stations track and infrastructure and passenger and freight rail lines these transportation assets are surrounded by a diversity of land uses and community assets including a wastewater treatment plant wwtp regional parks and neighborhood businesses among others that can experience co benefit s from adaptation strategies one of the focus areas the coliseum focus area also includes a priority development area pda where the anticipated housing and job growth is expected to occur as identified in plan bay area the san francisco bay area sustainable communities strategy scs regional transportat ion plan rtp required by state and federal law the scs describes land use development patterns and transportation investments intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by better aligning development with the transportation network including existing and planned high quality transit maps identifying the three focus areas and the selected assets are found in chapter es mtc climate adaptation pilot study next steps next steps this report has significantly enhanced the understanding of the vulnerability of certain key assets in alameda county to sea level ri se inundation across a range of scenarios it has also proposed a number of representati ve strategies to help reduce these vulnerabilities that could be applicable to other areas of alameda county as well as the wider bay area and beyond a number of the strategies sr drainage study and mainstreaming climate risk into transportation agen cies could be taken forward now with little further research by appropriate agencies and this report provides strong evidence to support the funding of these activities the physical strategies will all require further analysis and design work to ensure they are the most appropriate solutions to address future flooding from slr and other extreme weather events at the identified sites in addition these strategies could also be considered for potential use at other areas along the bay shoreline this report can be used to support funding applications for such analysis recommended next steps for each of the focus area strategies are included in their respective chapters and the compendium of strategies should be reviewed by the agencies and s trategies adopted that could be relatively easily incorporated into existing day today practice such as updating of design standards in relation to waterproof sealant other high scoring strategies should be identified for further analysis there were several informational strategies most notably the one on addressing the lack of understanding of the impact of saltwater intrusion on infrastructure for which assistance f rom local or national academia is needed efforts should be made to engage with potential universities and funders of such research such as the usgs the report also identified a number of studies being undertaken by other agencies in the county that could improve understanding of the vulnerability of assets such as the alameda county flood control and water conservation district s updated hec ras modelling for damon slough which would improve the riverine flooding analysis of the coliseum focus area the progress of these studies and analyses should be tracked so that this update can happen in a timely manner finally the findings from this study particularly in relation to vulnerable transportation assets and inundation flow paths should be used to inform decisions regarding the update of the bay areas sustainable communities strategy plan bay area mtc climate adaptation pilot study appendix dqualitative assessment of strategies aecom appendix d contains full results of the qualitative assessment described in section qualitative evaluation informational and governance strategies this section provides documentation of using the evaluation criteria on shortlisted informational and governance strategies in a qualitative way where quantitative data was readily available eg from the data collection exercise this data was noted to help inform the scoring we have not however looked up mtc model tables nor done any gis analysis for some of the costing we have made gross ball park assumptions eg cost of levee either side of sr would be very high groundwater and saltwater intrusion modeling info bay bridge and coliseum bart and other agencies would partner with appropriate academic institutions to research the impact sea level rise on local groundwater hydrology the research provides data applicable to drainage saltwater intrusion and seismic hazard the data would be used by engineers and planning staff to better evaluate asset

system and inform the drainage opportunities and constraints associated with the suite of potential physical adaptation strategi es bart planning process update gov this will be an overarching framework that can support the other information and governance strategies bart should develop planning process requirement to consider future climate change impacts as a standard part of project design rather than current conditions future conditions under a climate changed scenario should be planned for in line with the anticipated design life of the asset this is critical if bart wants to effectively add adaptation into asset renewal cycles bart could review caltrans guidance as a template also guidance coming from fta and fhwa caltrans sea level rise guidance enhancements gov caltrans has sea level rise guid ance for future project planning the guidance calls for sea level rise to be considered within project design if the project location and lifespan would likely expose the infrastructure to sea level rise caltrans should extend this guidance to cover rehabilitation projects for vulnerable assets consider future climate change impacts in decid i ng the timing of functional obsolescence consider future climate change impacts to eliminate risk from slr or storm surge impact consider sea level rise hazard protection design alternatives costs and benefits and consider climate changeinduced storm surge risks coordinate with permi tti ng agencies around sr gov hayward sr caltrans lead a multiagency working group to participate in a series of meetings to discuss potential sea level rise adaptation and risk mitigation strategies and the importance of these strategies to maintaining regional mobility this group should participate join in with current collaborations working in this focus area to ensure coordination meetings shou ld identify ways to streamline permitting processes especially biological reviews and avoid future adaptation project planning and implementation delays a key outcome would be to determine what an overarching permitting strategy might be for projects in the sr corridor to best address permitting needs in the long run potentially a programmatic permit solution could be developed with a or year timeframe that would allow large scale mitigation to occur for projects providing major ecological benefit and make permitting for individual projects more straightforward it would be important to start this coor dination we ll in advance of the planning of major infrastructure adaptation strategies as programmatic permits take time and effort to develop recent examples of successful programmatic permits include for high speed rail and the small erosion repair program for levees in northern california for the

this data was noted to help inform the scoring we have not however looked up mtc model tables nor done any gis analysis for some of the costing we have made gross ball park assumptions bay bridge focus area artificial dunes construct artificial dunes for the entire length of the lowlying section north of the bay bridge touchdown to retain the habitat value of that area while providing protection to the hwy bay bridge focus area offshore breakwater construct an offshore breakwat er to the north of the bay bridge touchdown this would not mitigate sea level rise but it would reduce storm surge and wave impacts and it would provide protection to the hwy and the adjacent habitats marsh dunes pocket sandy beac hes and it could provide protection to the emeryville crescent marsh area it would work in tandem with artificial dunes needed to retain habitat in the longer term bay bridge focus area shoreline protection north of bay bridge designed structure such as an engineered berm with rock revetment but maximizing the use of natural elements as much as possi ble to maintain the link with the valuable habitats in this area alongside road corridor to north of bridge i include active management such as periodic placement of sediment and restoration of wetland to help the wetlands and habitats keep pace with slr any shoreline structure constructed adjacent to i must take into account roadway drainage that would occur during rainfall events and consider the feasibility of collecting and potentially treating the roadway drainage before disposal to the bay coliseum focus area damon slough tide gate block damon slough just west of i and install a tide gate which will still allow the slough to drain during flood events and drop its sediment load behind the barrier but deny sea level rise to the coliseum area the tide gate would have to be raised periodically because of both the sediment deposition and sea level rise but that should be a small cost overall this concept is similar in design to the thames flood barrier on a much smaller scale and provides some transient storage at more advanced levels of sea level rise where gravity flow is lost provisio n for pumping stormwater to a point west of i will need to be considered coliseum focus area damon slough levee construct levees adjacent to either edge of damon slough from east of i to san leandro st to protect adjacent facilities and properties from future high tide levels mitigation for both habitat and recreation losses may need to be considered for this strategy this does not include i flood protection coliseum focus area damon slough living levee use a combination of natural restoration and aesthetic leveeswallsberms along the length of damon slough also implement policy changes to prevent certain types of future landuse changes that would allow the construction of facilities vulnerable to future sea level rise because the footprint of walls levees and berms would be relatively large mitigation for loss of habitat and recreation may be required this does not include i flood proofing this strategy will require land acquisition to be really be effective hayward focus area marsh management cooperative landward retreat a collective strategy to assess how the marshes and ponds north of sr can be managed and maintained over time currently this complex is managed by numerous public agencies that provide a combination of flood control wildlife habitat recreation and wastewater treatment if this larger compl ex is managed more collectively shifting uses could be considered over time between the smaller individual complexes over time protective measures and habitat goals could be adapted to respond to rising sea level and work toward the best and highest use of the land at that time incremental retreat from the existing shoreline and restoration efforts could also encourage high marsh development and increase the longevity of the marsh habitat this approach would entail establishing the primary line of defense for flood protection landward for much of the area either by maintaining existing landward berms or by constructing more substantial flood protection berms marshes and mudflats that are outboard of this line of defense would be allowed to transgress landward naturally with rising sea levels this approach would allow tidal marshes to naturally reduce wave heights reaching the landward levee thereby reducing flood and erosion risks and potentially the height to which levees must be raised to provide adequate flood management over time these outboard marshes may drown if they cannot keep pace with sea level rise thereby reducing their wave and flood protection potential hayward focus area maintain existing shoreline alignment this strategy would be to maintain the current shoreline alig nment and associated habitat values for as long as is practical currently this complex is managed by numerous public agencies that provide a combination of flood control wildlife habitat recreation and wastewater treatment to maintain the existing shoreline aka holding the line the bayside berm crest elevation would need to be raised to maintain existing le vels of protection this would require berm maintenance to keep pace with sea level rise although maintenance of the bayside berm could maintain the current mixture of uses in the near term this measure may not work indefinitely as water level management within portions of the complex may become more difficult as sea levels rise in the longterm this outer berm could be surrounded on all sides by open water as the marshes drown resulting in berms that will be more vulnerable to erosion and require increased longterm maintenance in addition as many of the berms are made of bay mud using local borrow material there may be a maximum height to which the berms can be constructed limited by geotechnical stability and availability of local borrow material in the longterm improving and maintaining the bayward berms may not be cost effective as rising sea levels and subsequent marsh drowning would eventually result in the levees becoming peninsulas that would be surrounded on all sides by open water leaving them vulnerable to damage from windwave erosion and subject to increased longterm maintenance costs aecom comparison of scores across strategies

vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project draft seisseir december greenhouse gas emissions and climate change introduction this section discusses existing conditions and the regulatory setting regarding greenhouse gas ghg emissions and it describes impacts under ceqa that would result from construction and operation of the ceqa alternatives existing conditions and regulatory setting affected environment the term ghg emissions refer s to a group of emissi ons that are generally believed to affect global climate conditions the greenhouse effect compares earth and the atmosphere surrounding it to a greenhouse with glass panes the glass panes in a greenhouse let heat from sunlight in and reduce the amount of heat that escapes ghgs such as carbon dioxide co methane ch and nitrous oxide n o keep the average surface temperature of earth cl ose to degrees fahrenheit f ghgs also include hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons sulfur hexafluoride and water vapor co is the most abundant pollutant that contributes to climate change through fossil fuel combustion the other ghgs are less abundant but have higher global warming potential than co to account for this higher potential emissions of other ghgs are frequen tly expressed in the equivalent mass of co denoted as co e long term and irrevocable shifts in weather including temperature precipitation and seasonal patterns are referred to as climate c hange according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change s fourth assessment report climate change caused by ghg emissions is anticipated to result in sea level rise climate related hazards extinction of species reduced food production exacer bated health problems slower economic growth and displacement of people according to a study by the union of concerned scientists and ecological society of america some of the possible effects of climate change in the bay area are as follows sealevel rise may threaten coastal wetlands infrastructure and property increased storm activity together with sea level rise could increase beach erosion and cliff undercutting warmer temperatures and more frequent storms due to el nio will bring more rain instead of snow to the sierras reducing supply of water for summer needs decreased summer runoff and warming ocean temperatures will affect salinity water circulation and nutrients in the bay possibly leading to complex changes in marine life santa clara valley transportation authority greenhouse gas emissions and climate change vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project draft seisseir december regulato ry setting state california has adopted a variety of statewide legislation to address various aspects of climate change and ghg emissions mitigation much of this legislation is not directed at citizens or jurisdictions specifically rather it establishes a broad framework for the states long term ghg reduction and climate change adaptation program the governor has also issued several executive orders related to the states evolving climate change policy below is a summary of ghg legislation applicable to the project senate bill sb sb required that the california natural resources agency coordinate on the preparation of amendments to the ceqa guidelines regarding feasible mitigation of ghg emissions or the effects of ghg emissions pursuant to sb the california natural resources agency adopted state ceqa guidelines amendments on december and transmitted the adopted amendments and the entire rulemaking file to the office of admi nistrative law on december the amendments were approved by the office of administrative law on february and became effective on march assembly bill ab requires the california air res ources board arb to develop and enforce regulations for the reporting and verification of statewide ghg emissions and directs arb to set a ghg emission limit based on levels to be achieved by the bill set a timeline for adopting a scoping plan for achieving ghg reductions in a technologically and economically feasible manner on december arb adopted the ab scoping plan which sets forth the framework for facilitating the states goal of reducing ghg emissions to levels by the first update of the ab scoping plan was adopted on may at this writing arb is drafting the next update of the scoping plan the second update is expected to include strategies to meet a ghg reduction goal of percent below levels the goal set out in eo b described below neither ab nor the updated ab scoping plan establish regulations implementing for specific projects the legislatures statewide goals for reducing ghgs center for biological diversity v california department of fish and game calth the ab scoping plan outlines a series of technologically feasible and cost effective measures to reduce statewide ghg emissions including expanding energy efficiency programs increasing electricity production from renewable resources at least percent of the statewide e lectricity mix increasing automobile efficiency implementing the lowcarbon fuel standard and developing a cap andtrade program the vast majority of the projects ghg emissions would result from mobile sources and energy multiple ab scoping plan measures address ghg emissions from transportation fuels and energy for example the cap andtrade program through the regulation of upstream electricity producers and fuel suppliers will account for ghg emissions from the project santa clara valley transportation authority greenhouse gas emissions and climate change vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project draft seisseir december and will require emiss ions from covered sectors to be reduced by the amount needed to achieve ab s goal likewise the low carbon fuel standard requires a percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by and therefore creates incentives for b roader scale deployment of alternative vehicle fuels as well as electricity similarly the states renewable s portfolio standard mandates that state utilities dramatically increase to percent by the percentage of electricity sales that are gener ated by eligible renewable generation sources together these elements of the ab scoping plan will ensure that overall statewide emissions will be decreased to the extent necessary to achieve ab s emissions reduction goals at the time the californi a natural resources agency promulgated state ceqa guidelines section the agency explained that the ab scoping plan may not be appropriate for use in determining the significance of individual projects because it is conceptual at this sta te and relies of the future development of regulations to implement and the strategies identified in the scoping plan california natural resources agency assembly bill ab requires the development and adoption of regulations to achieve the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by noncommercial passenger vehicles light duty trucks and other vehicles used primarily for personal transportation in the state in arb adopted amendments to the ab regulations that red uce ghg emissions in new passenger vehicles from through these amendments are part of californias commitment toward a nationwide program to reduce new passenger vehicle ghgs from through the goal is to increase average fuel

that pieces of heavy duty construction equipment would be operating simultaneously hours a day along the alignment the equipment could be s pread throughout the length of the alignment to do the construction work offsite emissions associated with the twin bore and s ingle bore options tunnel hauling trips were accounted for and based on the estimated total number of truck trips construction emissions for vtas transit oriented joint development tojd were estimated using caleemod inputs to the model include each land use type and size in terms of building area and the number of dwelling units details of the emissions analysis including calculation sheets and assumptions used for the caleemod runs are provided in vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project air quality study terry a hayes included as a technical report with this seisseir operation operational emissions associated with the bart extension have been estimated related to changes to regional vehicle miles traveled vmt and electricity production to support bart facilities because bart provides an alternative to vehicle trips it would contribute to a decrease in regional emissions from reductions in personal vehicle use also known as mode shift the america public transportation association recommends that ghg analyses for transit projects account for this emissions credit associated with avoided car trips through mode shift consistent with america public transportation association recommendations vta has used t his methodology for other transit projects ie phase i project throughout the

bart extension scenarios mobile source emissions were estimated using grams per mile emission rates by speed obtained from the arb emfac model ghg emissions to support bart electricity consumption associated with traction station lighting and station auxiliary power have been quantified using a power consumption rate of megawatt hour per bart vmt per day to calculate total daily power consumption the above power consumption rate was multiplied by the total length of the bart extension and the total number of train departuresarrivals in a day it is assumed that there would be minute headways between a m and p m and minute headways between am and a m and between p m and a m resulting in hourly train trips the stations and related facilities built as part of the bart extension would also use electric power this other energy requirement was calculated on a percentage basis about percent of barts existing power requirements are for station and facilities operations with the other percent for vehicle propulsion it was assumed that this relationship would apply to the bart extension as well based on data obtained from the air quality analysts annual electricity consumption for vehicle propulsion along the bart extension would be million kilowatt hours add itional electricity consumed by other facilities was therefore estimated to be about kilowatt hours per year the electricity intensity factors were obtained from the caleemod and used to calculate co emissions associated with the production of el ectricity consumed by operation of the bart extension california air pollution control officers association tojd operational emissions were estimated using caleemod def ault assumptions for the proposed land use types inputs to the model include each land use type and size in terms of building area the number of dwelling units and the vehicle trip generation for each land use mobile source emissions for the tojds were estimated using trip generation rates provided by hexagon transportation consultants inc the ghg analysis for the tojds relies on the service population residents plus employees estimates for residents were based on rates available in caleemod for multi family residences the utilized population rate was people per dwelling unit the employee rates for retail and office use were and employees per square feet respectively the assumptions resulted in a service population of persons ceqa thresholds of significance state ceqa guidelines appendix g identifies the following significance criteria to be considered for determining

purpose of reducing the emissions of ghgs baaqmd has not recommended a quantitative threshold for the evaluation of construction related ghg emissions the significance of construction ghg emissions is evaluated by determining whether a project is consistent with ab ghg reduction goals baaqmd baaqmd also recommends that lead agencies incorporate best management practices to reduce ghg emissions during construction with respect to operational emissions baaqmd has not recommended a significance threshold for transit projects that include tojds in addition there is no consensus between state regional and local agencies related to addressing potential impacts from transit related ghg emissions californ ia air pollution control officials and air quality districts have made several proposals for numerical thresholds multiple agencies efforts at framing ghg significance issues have not yet coalesced into any widely accepted set of numerical significance t hresholds for transit projects although baaqmd has not established a significance threshold for transit projects significance thresholds have been established for land use developments such as the tojds baaqmds guidelines establish three potential an alysis criteria for land use development projects compliance with a qualified cap a mass emissions threshold of metric tons mt per year of co e and a ghg efficiency threshold of mt co e per serv ice population project jobs plus projected residents baaqmds thresholds are based on ab s requirement to reduce statewide ghg emissions from both existing and new development to levels by the state ceqa guidelines authorize the lead agenc y to consider thresholds of significance previously adopted or recommended by other public agencies or recommended by experts provided the decision of the lead agency to adopt such thresholds is supported by substantial evidence state ceqa guidelines sec tions a and c given that there is no drafted adopted or recommended threshold specific to transit projects and that transit projects are inherently designed to reduce ghg emissions vta has established that the proposed project would result in a significant ghg impact if it were to result in an emissions increase above net zero because the bart extension with tojd alternative would include tojd ghg emissions associated with the tojds are also evaluated relative to baaqmds mt co e per service population threshold this comparison is done for informational purposes only the final impact determination is based on the net zero threshold although there is no adopted state plan that addresses ghg emission reduction beyond longterm goals for and have been articulated in eo b and eo s respectively there is a bill being considered in the state legislature to adopt an interim binding ghg target to date however there are no proposed or adopted sig nificance the target of percent below levels may be adopted in legislation per the proposed sb which was withdrawn during the legislative term but is expected to be considered in the legislative term santa clara valley transportation authority greenhouse gas emissions and climate change vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project draft seisseir december thresholds for analyzing post emissions for development projects in california nevertheless given the recent legislative attention on post goals and scientific evidence that additional ghg reductions are needed through to stabili ze co concentrations the association of environmental professionals aep climate change committee recommended in a white paper that ceqa analyses for projects with post develo pment not only consider consistency with the ab based framework but also analyze the consequences of post ghg emissions in terms of their impacts on the reduction trajectory from toward aep further recommends that the significance determinationshould be based on consistency with substantial progress along a post trajectory consistent with aeps recommendation and general scientific understanding that there will be a need for deeper r eductions in ghg emissions in the post period see further discussion in the aep white paper referenced in this section this document maintains the stringent net zero threshold to evaluate long term operational emissions under design year con ditions ghg emissions associated with the tojds in are also assessed for informational purposes relative to the substantial progress indicator based on the and reduction targets identified in eo b and eo s respectively clim ate change is a global problem and ghgs are global pollutants unlike criteria air pollutants such as ozone precursors which are primarily pollutants of regional and local concern given their long atmospheric lifetimes ghgs emitted by many sources wo rldwide accumulate in the atmosphere no single emitter of ghgs is large enough to trigger global climate change on its own rather climate change is the result of the individual contributions of countless past present and future sources thus ghg impa cts are inherently cumulative environmental consequences and mitigation measures this section identifies the impacts related to ghg emissions and climate change under ceqa and the mitigation measures necessary to reduce potentially significant impacts no build alternative the no build alternative consists of the existing transit and roadway networks and planned and programmed transportation improvements see chapter section nepa no build alternative for a list of these projects and other land development projects planned by the cities of san jose and santa clara the substantial progress indicator was calculated for based on the ghg reduction goals established under eo b and eo s percent reduction below levels by and percent reduction below levels by taking into account the emissions levels and the projected statewide populat ion and employment levels santa clara valley transportation authority greenhouse gas emissions and climate change vtas bart silicon valley phase ii extension project draft seisseir december the no build alternative projects could result in effects on greenhouse gases typically associated with transit highway bicycle and pedestrian facilities and roadw ay projects as well as land development projects under the no build alternative the project would not be built and regional vmt would not be reduced by the bart extension table shows the comparison between no build alternative bart extension alternative and bart extension with tojd alternative emissions the net reduction in ghg emissions associated with the bart extension would not be realized under the no build alternative in addition the tojds would not occur development of which would be entirely consistent with development goals established in ghg reduction plans all individual projects planned under the no build alternative would undergo separate environmental review to identify effects on greenhouse gases review would include an analysis of impacts and identification of mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts bart extension alternative impact bart extension ghg generate ghg emissions either directly or indirectly construction construction of the bart extension would generate direct emissions of co ch and n o from mobile and stationary construction equipment exhaust as well as employee and haul truck vehicle exhaust indirect emissions would be generated from water use for fugitive dust control it is estima ted that total ghg emissions associated with construction of the bart extension would be and mt of co e for the twin bore and s ingle bore options respectively because construction activity would last years estimated average annual co e emissions associated with the twin bore and single bore options would be and mt of co e respectively baaqmds ceqa guidelines do not identify a quantitative ghg emission threshold for construction emissions instead baaqmd recommends that ghg emissions from construction be quantified and disclosed and that a determination regarding the significance of the ghg emissions be made both the implement ation of best management practices and a projects consistency with ab ghg emission reduction goals are considered air quality mitigation would require baaqmd recommended basic construction mitigation measures ie best

urban design and land use planning are critical to the success of san joses green vision the city aims to promote high density commercial and residential development near transit or on infill sites this can be accomplished by increased transit options in the city therefore the discussion of long term planning in the green vision is consistent with the bart extension the city of santa clara cap includes a focus area related to reducing vmt for the se rvice population ie residents and employees the bart extension would increase transit ridership within the citys service population and reduce regional vmt this result would be consistent with the city of santa clara cap goal of promoting ghg reduc tions by conserving resources and reducing the impacts of both existing and new development on the local and regional environment as described in the california air pollution controls officers association resource document quantifying greenhouse gas mitig ation measures a city general plan that locates urban land uses near transit is the single greatest tool for reducing ghg emission related climate change implementation of the bart extension and the rail system would result in a regional ghg benefit by e ncouraging a modal shift from single occupancy vehicles to transit it is anticipated that transit oriented developments would locate infill residential and office development near transit lines that would be within walking distance and minimize automobile dependent development therefore the bart extension would be consistent with the city of santa clara cap and city of san jose

executive summary es executive summary the santa clara valley transportation authority vta has prepared this environmental impact statement eis in accordance with the national environmental policy act nepa the eis addresses the environmental impacts resulting from the three alternatives as discussed in chapter alternatives the original draft environmental impact studyenvironmental impact report eiseir was released to the public on march however no action was taken to finalize the original draft eis due to the passage of time changes in the project and environmental setting availability of new information and funding considerations a revised eis has been prepared the two proposed san francisco bay area rapid transit bart extension alternatives would extend service in the silicon valley rapid transit corridor svrtc the berryessa extension project bep alternative the recommended project and the alternative to be evaluated under the federal transit administration s fta new starts program is included in the document and is a mile twostation extension to milpitas and san jose the svrtp alternative would extend bart service for miles into santa clara a no build alternative has been formulated as a basis for comparison to the two build alternatives vta requested reentry into the new starts program as part of a federal funding request in september to the fta for the bep alternative in consultation with fta adjustments were made to the travel demand model subsequent to the draft eis to reflect changes to the bep alternative s scope and definition for the purpose of improving the projec ts co st effectiveness rating under new starts criteria these adjustments refined the definition of the bep alternative revised project data include the vta operating plan vta bus and bart fleet size ridership projections vehicle miles traveled capital cost estimates and related project elements these new data have reduced some of the impacts previously discussed in the draft eis however some benefits of the bep alternative are slightly less than stated previously the analysis in volume i of the final eis has not been updated except where noted in chapter financial considerations to reflect capital and operatingmaintenance costs and chapter evaluation of alternatives new starts evaluation criteria therefore the document provides a conservative analysis and disclosure of environmental impacts part of chapter evaluation of alternatives provides a summary of new starts changes to the project and a discussion of related impacts silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis es executive summary the recommended project presented in volume chapter of the final eis represents a fullyupdated description of the bep alternative including the project scope and definition assumed for the new starts locally preferred alternative silicon valley berryessa extension project submitted to fta in september this executive summary highlights the information that is presented in detail throughout this eis for specific discussion the reader is directed to the document chapters or sections that address that topic study area the svrtc extends over miles from the city of fremont in southwestern alameda county through the cities of milpitas san jose and santa clara in santa clara county covering approximately square miles figure es major roadway transportation facilities in the svrtc include interstate i interstate i us hi ghway us and state routes and sr and sr the corridor is also traversed by two freight railroad mainlines and commuter rail interstate and state routes expressways and major arterials vta caltrain altamont commuter express ace capitol corridor intercity rail capitols amtrak and a variety of bus operators provide transit services to major activity and employment centers located throughout the corridor purpose and need for transportation improvements the svrtc project is intended to achieve the following objectives improve public transit service in this severely congested corridor by providing increased transit capacity and faster convenient access to and from major santa clara county employment and activity centers for corridor residents and residents from throughout the bay area and portions of the central valley of california enhance regional connectivity by expanding and interconnecting bart rapid transit service with vta light rail amtrak ace caltrain and vta bus services in santa clara county improve intermodal transit hubs where rail bus auto bicycle and pedestrian links meet increase transit ridership by expanding modal options in a corridor with ever increasing travel demand that cannot be accommodated by existing or proposed roadway facilities in particular help alleviate severe and worsening

populations improve regional air quality by reducing auto emissions support local and regional land use plans and facilitate corridor citie s efforts to direct business and residential investments in transit oriented development more efficient growth and sustainable development patterns are necessary to reduce impacts to the local and global environment such as adverse climate change improved transit in the svrtc is consistent with the goals established in prior studies see section of chapter purpose and need and responds to the longrange valley transportation plan vtp adopted by vta in february the primary goal of the longrange plan is to provide transportation facilities and services that support and enhance santa clara county s high quality of life and vibrant economy transportation improvements in the corridor would address issues identified in the metropolitan transportation commission s m tc regional transportation plans t and pending t including the need to improve access and thereby preserve economic vitality and the need to link transportation to community development around transit nodes improved transit also is consistent with the policy directions of vta s shortrange transit plan and santa clara county measure a that measure approved by percent of santa clara county voters provides a year cent sales tax beginning in for a set of transit improvements in santa clara county with the key improvement being the svrtp alternative more recently the vta board of directors voted to place on the november general election ballot a sales tax increment measure b dedicated to operation of a bart extension project measure b was approved by approximately percent of the voters of santa clara county meeting the stringent twothirds approval threshold for general tax measures in california the measure is to go into effect when vta executes a full funding grant agreement ffga or its equivalent with the federal transit administration fta for at least million and the state of california contributes at least million in remaining traffic congestion relief program tcrp andor other funds to the project the state has reconfirmed its commitment to provide the remaining tcrp funds the request for fta funding is anticipated to be submitted later this year if new starts funding is approved measure b tax collections would begin and continue for years silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis executive summary es funds from measures a and b supplemented by the million in fta new starts program and the million in state of california funds would form the foundation for the capital and operating financial plan for the proposed bep and svrtp alternatives purpose of the eis and section f evaluation this document is an eis and section f evaluation prepared pursuant to the requirements of the council on environmental quality regulations implementing nepa it presents alternatives for improving transit services in the svrtc and discloses the environmental impacts of those alternatives this document will be used by federal state regional and local agencies to assess the environmental impacts of the alternatives on resources under their jurisdiction andor to make discretionary decisions regarding the project the fta the state of california and the metropolitan transportation commission mtc will use this document in deciding whether and how to fund the project to the extent that this document analyzes effects of various alternatives that extend beyond the potentially federally funded new starts portion of the overall transit project it does so solely for purposes of meeting fta s resp onsibility pursuant to section g of nepa usc section g to make available to states counties municipalities institutions and individuals advice and information useful in restoring maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment once the project is approved public agencies can use this eis as the basis for their decisions to issue permits and other approvals necessary to construct the project the eis includes the following chapters with supporting information found in the appendices executive summary chapter purpose and need chapter alternatives chapter transportation analysis chapter affected environment chapter environmental consequences chapter construction silicon valley rapid transit corridor final

chapter distribution of the final eis chapter definitions chapter references chapter list of preparers alternatives the draft eis evaluated three alternatives the future nobuild a transportation systems management tsm alternative with enhanced bus service and the propose d bart extension on the basis of that draft eis fta and vta have decided that the tsm alternative is not a reasonable alternative because it does not meet the proje cts purpose and need the buses which operate on highways are subject to the same congestion as automobiles therefore the revised eis will evaluate the following alternatives plus any additional alternatives that emerge from the scoping process no build alternative the no build alternative consists of the existing transit and roadway networks and planned and programmed improvements in the svrtc that are identified in the bay area s reg ional transportation plan rtp mobility for the next generation transportation plan for the san francisco bay

res olution no a resolution of the board of directors of the santa clara valley transportatio n authority declaring a climate emergency whereas according to the world meteorological association the last years were the hottest years on record and the warmest years on record have occurred within the past years whereas global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide the primary heattrapping or greenhouse gas have increased by percent since preindustrial times from parts per million to parts per million primarily due to human activities including burning fossil fuels and deforestation are rising at a rate of to parts per million annually and must be reduced to not more than parts per million and likely lower if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted according to former national aeronautics and space administration climatologist dr james hansen whereas global atmospheric concentrations of other greenhouse gases including methane nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons have also increased substantially since preindustrial times primarily due to human activities including burning fossil fuels whereas current climate science and realworld observations of climate change impacts including ocean warming ocean acidification floods droughts wildfires and extreme weather demonstrate that a global rise in temperatures of degree celsius above preindustrial levels is already having dangerous impacts on human populations and the environment whereas the national climate assessment found that climate change due to global warming has caused and is expected to cause additional substantial interference with and growing losses to infrastructure property industry recreation natural resources agricultural systems human health and safety and quality of life in the united states whereas the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has determined that climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather and other climaterelated disasters including drought wildfire and storms that include precipitation whereas climaterelated natural disasters have increased exponentially over the past decade costing the united states more than double the longterm average during the period of through with total costs of natural disasters during that period of approximately billion per year whereas the centers for disease control and prevention has found wideranging acute and fatal public health consequences from climate change that impact communities across the united states a whereas the national climate and health assessment of the united states global change research program identified climate change as a significant threat to the health of the people of the united states leading to increased temperaturerelated deaths and illnesses air quality impacts extreme weather events numbers of vectorborne diseases waterborne illnesses food safety nutrition and distribution complications and mental health and wellbeing concerns whereas the consequences of climate change already disproportionately impact frontline communities and endanger populations made especially vulnerable by existing exposure to extreme weather events such as children the elderly and individuals with preexisting disabilities and health conditions whereas individuals and families on the frontlines of climate change across the united states including territories living with income inequality and poverty institutional racism inequity on the basis of gender and sexual orientation poor infrastructure and lack of access to health care housing clean water and food security are often in close proximity to environmental stressors or sources of pollution particularly communities of color indigenous communities and lowincome communities which experience outsized risk because of the close proximity of the community to environmental hazards and stressors in addition to collocation with waste and other sources of pollution are often the first exposed to the impacts of climate change and have the fewest resources to mitigate those impacts or to relocate which will exacerbate preexisting challenges whereas in the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change projected that the earth could warm degrees celsius above preindustrial levels as early as whereas the climatic changes resulting from global warming above degrees celsius above preindustrial levels including changes resulting from global warming of more than degrees celsius above preindustrial levels are projected to result in irreversible catastrophic changes to public health livelihoods quality oflife food security water supplies human security and economic growth whereas in the united nations intergovernmental sciencepolicy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services found that humaninduced climate change is pushing the planet toward the sixth mass species extinction which threatens the food security water supply and wellbeing of billions of people whereas according to climate scientists limiting global warming to not more than degrees celsius above preindustrial levels and likely lower is most likely to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change whereas even with global warming up to degrees celsius above preindustrial levels the planet is projected to experience a significant rise in sea levels extraordinary loss of biodiversity intensifying droughts prodigious floods devastating wildfires and other extreme weather events resolution a whereas according to climate scientists addressing the climate emergency will require an economically just and managed phaseout of the use of oil gas and coal to keep fossil fuels in the ground whereas the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change has determined that limiting warming through emissions reduction and carbon sequestration will require rapid and immediate acceleration and proliferation of farreaching multilevel and crosssectoral climate mitigation and transitions in energy land urban and rural infrastructure including transport and buildings and industrial systems whereas massive comprehensive and urgent governmental action is required immediately to achieve the transitions of those systems in response to the severe existing and projected economic social public health and national security threats posed by the climate crisis whereas the massive scope and scale of action necessary to stabilize the climate will require unprecedented levels of public awareness engagement and deliberation to develop and implement effective just and equitable policies to address the climate crisis whereas on september governor newsom issued executive order n which called on the entire state government of california to redouble its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change while building a stable inclusive economy whereas a number of local jurisdictions and governments in the united states and across the world have already declared a climate emergency and a number of state and local governments are considering declaring a climate emergency in response to the massive challenges posed by the climate crisis now therefore be it resolved by the santa clara valley transportation authority board of directors that global climate change caused by human activities has resulted in a climate emergency which demands mobilization at a massive scale to halt reverse mitigate and prepare for the consequences of the climate emergency and to restore the climate for future generations vt a staff will evaluate administrative procedures to incorporate the consideration of climate change impacts for all relevant proposed policies programs or actions approved by the board of directors vt a will identify specific metrics including objectives and targets to prioritize opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop a climate action plan to guide its climate emergency response vta will support legislative efforts to avert climate change by federal state regional and local entities and join with stakeholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector passed and adopted by the santa clara valley transportation authority board of resolution a directors on february by the following vote ayes noes carr carrasco chavez cortese diep hendricks jones liccardo mcalister peralez rennie tran none absent none board of directors i hereby

that can be marketed to the public and its riders deliver a sustainable project that can be showcase d within all of the participating design build firms as the signature s ustainable project commit to adding more sustainable measures than pr eviously prescribed by the vta attempt to implement voluntary nonmandatory susta inable measures the above listed goals are not contract requirement s to ssh ssh has internally set these goals as necessary to implementing a successf ul sustainable project section sustainability commitment commitment statement the team will efficiently implement the prescriptiv e sustainability measures as listed in the sustainability measures checklist at tachment a of adapted from california code of regulations ccr calgreen par t of title edition and record benefits associated with each measure reco rding of benefits are explained in more detail under sections and below the sust ainability measures checklist is also duplicated in this plan and expanded in detail in the appendices all measures identified as mandatory are prescriptive requirem ents of the contract with vta in addition tier and measures identified as manda tory are prescriptive requirements as well ssh jv is firmly committed to efficient i mplementation of all mandatory sustainable measures voluntary measures are purel y voluntary as defined by vta ssh jv will not discard any voluntary measures and will make efforts to implement these measures as deemed appropriate or as directed by vta sustainability opportunities project specific for svbx section elaborates on the sustainability opport unities specific to the svbx project the work areas identified below are proje ct specific to the svbx project generally speaking the primary opportunities for s howcasing sustainability will be at the transit and wayside building facilities where the m ain building structures are located there are also sustainability opportunities along t he guideway by properly regusing soil waste and construction materials by diverting thes e materials from landfills the paragraphs below summarize these opportunity areas p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n transit and wayside building facilities the majority of the sustainability measures as ide ntified by vta in attachment a of will pertain to building facilities t hese building facilities will be milpitas station berryessa station multiple wayside facili ties and the vta montague lrt station some the measures will pertain to the wayside build ing facilities the primary benefit of implementing sustainability meas ures at the buildings will be reduced operating and life cycle costs for the end user t he sustainability plan as presented in sections below have mechanisms for properly a ssigning responsible parties and tracking progress of the numerous sustainable measu res that pertain to the transit and wayside building facilities hazardous materials management the technical specifications of the contract provi de ssh with requirements on how to properly handle hazardous materials the existing hazardous materials on the project site are well documented and identified ssh is require d and will be submitting a hazardous materials management plan hmmp construction wast e management plan cwmp and other remedial investigation action plans to vta un der separate cover ssh intends to submit these other plans under separate cover becau se they are submittal requirements of other technical specifications and will allow more detail and information to be included soils management per the advanced design of the guideway as provide d by vta in the rfp the project is a net export job with a large volume of soils an d ballast required to be removed from the rightgofgway excavated soils and land clearing de bris is not considered construction waste per the sustainable measures checklist but ssh int ends to voluntarily divert soils from the landfills to the maximum extent possible ssh will be implementing best management practices bmps by minimizing hauling and disposin g of soils furthermore the team will also evaluate voluntary reguse of hazardous soil in a manner acceptable to stakeholders ssh intends to encapsulate as much native soil mate rial as possible within the project limits of c the effort required to remove soils from the rightgofgway is a direct function of cost the benefits of minimizing haul and disposal of the se soils are the following reduced carbon dioxide emissions and footprint less impact and da mage to haul routes and reduced risk of contaminating streets and storm drains with soil de bris depending on the market conditions in the bay area at the time of construction operati ons opportunities for nonglandfill third parties to acquire suitable soils could arise ssh also intends to identify suitable sites for delivery of exported soils to reduce or eliminate l andfill disposal existing track material removal the svbx project requires the removal of existing union pacific railroad track from the rightgofgway to allow construction of new track for bart ssh will be subcontracting this work to a track removal subcontractor who performs this work vta has specified a sustainable practice of salvaging for reguse of running rail and large pieces of specialty trackwork the remainder of steel runnin g rail not intended for vtas use has the opportunity to be diverted from the landfill and re cycled ssh envisions an opportunity to p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n divert of steel running rail from the landfill in regards to railroad ties there is a demand in the market for reguse of existing wood ti es that are ungdamaged damaged ties will need to be separated and diverted to a landfil l certified to handle creosote treated railroad ties the track removal subcontractor wil l separate damaged from undamaged wood ties all track materials specified to be rem oved from the rightgofgway will be measured reported and verified against the requir ement to recycle andor salvage for reuse a minimum of of nonhazardous construction waste groundwater reusedisposal there does not appear to be a sustainability measu re requirement in the checklist attachment a of pertaining to reuse of g roundwater ssh does have the opportunity to implement processes to reuse groundw ater extracted from dewatering wells as an added sustainability measure groundwater co llected as a result of dewatering operations could be used for dust control and soil compaction operations reuse of groundwater will reduce the demand to obtain water from potable water sources ie hydrants city and county supplies etc vta has identified certain locations where groundwater has been contaminated to hazardous leve ls if extracted groundwater contains chemical constituents that exceed acceptable reguse criteria then the groundwater will be treated prior to further use or appropriately dispo sed the remediation could serve as a sustainable measure supported by this plan onsite reuse of demolition debris as recyclable mat erials ssh intends to process and use certain demolition debris as new materials for the project see table below for summary of these sustainable opportunities existing ma terial diverted from landfill salvage recycle or reuse as ballast and subgballast earthwork fill in areas designed to be excavated ac pcc process into usable aggregate material where allowed by the specification trees stumps and associated vegetation mulch erosion control at upc topsoil or common backfill onsite where allowed by the specifications the cwmp will provide more specific detail on how c ertain demolition debris will be processed into reusable products the primary g oal is to keep processed materials on site for end use without the need to haul materi al offgsite by truck the demand for processed ballast ac pcc and organic material as regusable material does exist in p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n the bay area with a strong possibility a large majo rity by percentage of these materials can be diverted from the landfill recycle bins for construction waste ssh will be renting high volume recycle waste bins for wood and steel waste materials wood and steel are common construction resources used to facilitate construction of a structure wood material is typi cally generated from concrete formwork once the formwork can no longer be reused wood fo rms will be used repetitively prior to its diversion to the recycle bin steel material is ty pically generated from extra rebar and miscellaneous metals delivered to the jobsite the re are firms who typically provide these waste bins as a recycling service to construction s ites as a requirement of section waste management ssh will contract with an ap proved recycling firm listed with the counties of alameda and santa clara our commitmen t here is to further ensure we are recycling or reusing more than of nonhazardous construction and demolition debris section implementation process and responsibilities sustainability coordinator the sustainability coordinator coordinator w ill be the responsible for and in charge

budgets approved by the board of directors included a total of million for green sustainability facility improvements the purpose of this project was to assess and implement improvements at vta facilities to address issues of environmental concern and energy efficiency vt as environmental programs and resource management and facilities maintenance departments are responsible for identifying and implementing the green sustainability facility improvements with the assistance of an interdepart mental team in the first six months of the project the team has initiated cettifications ofvta as a green business with santa clara county and with the us green building council replaced highemission vehicles with hybrid vehicles for protective services and constrnction staff collected data on vt as baseline energy watersewer and solid waste use and is researching various sustainable actions including installation of solar power facilities the team is also working with the santa clara valley water district and pge to conduct facility audits that identify nocost and lowcost as well as larger capital investment projects that can be considered for implemen tation attachment b provides a more detailed listing of activities and projects underway discussion vt a currently does not have formal guidelines for sustainability program goals and implementation by establishing guidelines for the program including goals and implementation strategies vta can more consistently consider sustainability in the procurement of products and in the planning design construction and operation of vt as facilities the sustainability program guidelines will allow vt a to consider the long term benefits as well as shatter term budgetary issues during the procurement evaluations approving the sustainability program would be the first step in improving vt as practices and procedures to consider the environmental benefits and the operational efficiencies of sustainability in the planning designing supporting and operating transportation facilities throughout the county as well one of the major challenges in considering sustainability is evaluating the potentially higher upfront cost versus the longer term benefits of the more sustainabl e but higher cost product in many cases sustainable products or sustainable project features may initially cost more than conventional products or technologies sustainable features such as renewable energy systems energyefficient lighting or droughtresistant landscaping may have a higher initial capital costs but may prove to be costeffective when a consideration of sustainability and long term efficiency goals are taken into consideration environmental sustainability is just one of many factors that would be considered in the planning and procurement process over the longer term the sustainability program should result in a financial benefit to vta in terms of facility operating efficiencie s and energy savings however the approval of the sustainability program could also result in an increase in the initial project and procurement costs for vta one of the implementation strategies of program is to evaluate the best practices and products which can offset the higher upfront costs with cost savings from the efficient use of energy the reduction in waste and the conservation of natural resources one of the next steps of the sustainability program will be to develop product procurement costbenefit decisionmaking criteria incorporating analysis of the lifecycle return on investments and guidelines on the allowable increase in cost for incorporating sustainable features into a project or purchase page of in the future as additional technologies and other specific implementation approaches are developed vt a staff will report back to the board of directors on progress at accomplishing the goals and strategies contained in the sustainability program alternatives the alternative is to make no changes to vtas current policies and procedures or modify program guidelines pursuant to board direction fiscal impact the approved vta operating and capital fy and budget includes for initiation of the sustainability program including vta staff support for coordination of the program and lower cost nearterm capital improvements continuation of the program beyond fy will require future budget appropriations

features to be incorporated into the project along with anticipated environmental and cost savings including a calculated return on investment the green building principles listed in the policy provide a variety of ways to conserve natural resources reduce waste support the local economy provide healthy indoor environments and generate longterm cost savings vta employees would be directed to incorporate green building principles into vta projects as applicable and to the maximum extent possible in the development of this policy vta consulted with several agencies including san bernardino county public transit regional transportation commission of southern nevada los angeles metro california high speed rail authority bay area rapid transit and county of santa clara to gather information about the costs and benefits of green building the findings demonstrate the following costs savings are achieved primarily through reduced energy costs because green buildings are on average more energy efficient when compared to conventional buildings the average return on investment for green buildings is for existing buildings and for new buildings operating costs decreased by for new construction and for existing buildings building value increased by for new construction and for existing buildings california construction codes are already requiring much of what leadership in energy and environmental design leed requires in the areas of water energy materials indoor air quality and alternative fueled vehicles therefore many agencies can achieve leed certification in

design of the guideway as provide d by vta in the rfp the project is a net export job with a large volume of soils an d ballast required to be removed from the rightgofgway excavated soils and land clearing de bris is not considered construction waste per the sustainable measures checklist but ssh int ends to voluntarily divert soils from the landfills to the maximum extent possible ssh will be implementing best management practices bmps by minimizing hauling and disposin g of soils furthermore the team will also evaluate voluntary reguse of hazardous soil in a manner acceptable to stakeholders ssh intends to encapsulate as much native soil mate rial as possible within the project limits of c the effort required to remove soils from the rightgofgway is a direct function of cost the benefits of minimizing haul and disposal of the se soils are the following reduced carbon dioxide emissions and footprint less impact and da mage to haul routes and reduced risk of contaminating streets and storm drains with soil de bris depending on the market conditions in the bay area at the time of construction operati ons opportunities for nonglandfill third parties to acquire suitable soils could arise ssh also intends to identify suitable sites for delivery of exported soils to reduce or eliminate l andfill disposal existing track material removal the svbx project requires the removal of existing union pacific railroad track from the rightgofgway to allow construction of new track for bart ssh will be subcontracting this work to a track removal subcontractor who performs this work vta has specified a sustainable practice of salvaging for reguse of running rail and large pieces of specialty trackwork the remainder of steel runnin g rail not intended for vtas use has the opportunity to be diverted from the landfill and re cycled ssh envisions an opportunity to p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n divert of steel running rail from the landfill in regards to railroad ties there is a demand in the market for reguse of existing wood ti es that are ungdamaged damaged ties will need to be separated and diverted to a landfil l certified to handle creosote treated railroad ties the track removal subcontractor wil l separate damaged from undamaged wood ties all track materials specified to be rem oved from the rightgofgway will be measured reported and verified against the requir ement to recycle andor salvage for reuse a minimum of of nonhazardous construction waste groundwater reusedisposal there does not appear to be a sustainability measu re requirement in the checklist attachment a of pertaining to reuse of g roundwater ssh does have the opportunity to implement processes to reuse groundw ater extracted from dewatering wells as an added sustainability measure groundwater co llected as a result of dewatering operations could be used for dust control and soil compaction operations reuse of groundwater will reduce the demand to obtain water from potable water sources ie hydrants city and county supplies etc vta has identified certain locations where groundwater has been contaminated to hazardous leve ls if extracted groundwater contains chemical constituents that exceed acceptable reguse criteria then the groundwater will be treated prior to further use or appropriately dispo sed the remediation could serve as a sustainable measure supported by this plan onsite reuse of demolition debris as recyclable mat erials ssh intends to process and use certain demolition debris as new materials for the project see table below for summary of these sustainable opportunities existing ma terial diverted from landfill salvage recycle or reuse as ballast and subgballast earthwork fill in areas designed to be excavated ac pcc process into usable aggregate material where allowed by the specification trees stumps and associated vegetation mulch erosion control at upc topsoil or common backfill onsite where allowed by the specifications the cwmp will provide more specific detail on how c ertain demolition debris will be processed into reusable products the primary g oal is to keep processed materials on site for end use without the need to haul materi al offgsite by truck the demand for processed ballast ac pcc and organic material as regusable material does exist in p a g e s u b m i t t a l r e v i s i o n the bay area with a strong possibility a large majo rity by percentage of these materials can be diverted from the landfill recycle bins for construction waste ssh will be renting high volume recycle waste bins for wood and steel waste materials wood and steel are common construction resources used to facilitate construction of a structure wood material is typi cally generated from concrete formwork once the formwork can no longer be reused wood fo rms will be used repetitively prior to its diversion to the recycle bin steel material is ty pically generated from extra rebar and miscellaneous metals delivered to the jobsite the re are firms who typically provide these waste bins as a recycling service to construction s ites as a requirement of section waste management ssh will contract with an ap proved recycling firm listed with the counties of alameda and santa clara our commitmen t here is to further ensure we are recycling or reusing more than of nonhazardous

united states department of agriculturea product of the national cooperative soil survey a joint effort of the united states department of agriculture and other federal agencies state agencies including the agricultural experiment stations and local participantscustom soil resource report for santa clara area california western part natural resources conservation service january preface soil surveys contain information that affects land use planning in survey areas they highlight soil limitations that affect various land uses and provide information about the properties of the soils in the survey areas soil surveys are designed for many different users including farmers ranchers foresters agronomists urban planners community officials engineers developers builders and home buyers also conservationists teachers students and specialists in recreation waste disposal and pollution control can use the surveys to help them understand protect or enhance the environment various land use regulations of federal state and local governments may impose special restrictions on land use or land treatment soil surveys identify soil properties that are used in making various land use or land treatment decisions the information is intended to help the land users identify and reduce the effects of soil limitations on various land uses the landowner or user is responsible for identifying and complying with existing laws and regulations although soil survey information can be used for general farm local and wider area planning onsite investigation is needed to supplement this information in some cases examples include soil quality assessments httpwwwnrcsusdagovwps portalnrcsmainsoilshealth and certain conservation and engineering applications for more detailed information contact your local usda service center httpsofficesscegovusdagovlocatorappagencynrcs or your nrcs state soil scientist httpwwwnrcsusdagovwpsportalnrcsdetailsoilscontactus cidnrcsp great differences in soil properties can occur within short distances some soils are seasonally wet or subject to flooding some are too unstable to be used as a foundation for buildings or roads clayey or wet soils are poorly suited to use as septic tank absorption fields a high water table makes a soil poorly suited to basements or underground installations the national cooperative soil survey is a

specific area they include a description of the soils and miscellaneous areas and their location on the landscape and tables that show soil properties and limitations affecting various uses soil scientists observed the steepness length and shape of the slopes the general pattern of drainage the kinds of crops and native plants and the kinds of bedrock they observed and described many soil profiles a soil profile is the sequence of natural layers or horizons in a soil the profile extends from the surface down into the unconsolidated material in which the soil formed or from the surface down to bedrock the unconsolidated material is devoid of roots and other living organisms and has not been changed by other biological activity currently soils are mapped according to the boundaries of major land resource areas mlras mlras are geographically associated land resource units that share common characteristics related to physiography geology climate water resources soils biological resources and land uses usda soil survey areas typically consist of parts of one or more mlra the soils and miscellaneous areas in a survey area occur in an orderly pattern that is related to the geology landforms relief climate and natural vegetation of the area each kind of soil and miscellaneous area is associated with a particular kind of landform or with a segment of the landform by observing the soils and miscellaneous areas in the survey area and relating their position to specific segments of the landform a soil scientist develops a concept or model of how they were formed thus during mapping this model enables the soil scientist to predict with a considerable degree of accuracy the kind of soil or miscellaneous area at a specific location on the landscape commonly individual soils on the landscape merge into one another as their characteristics gradually change to construct an accurate soil map however soil scientists must determine the boundaries between the soils they can observe only a limited number of soil profiles nevertheless these observations supplemented by an understanding of the soilvegetationlandscape relationship are sufficient to verify predictions of the kinds of soil in an area and to determine the boundaries soil scientists recorded the characteristics of the soil profiles that they studied they noted soil color texture size and shape of soil aggregates kind and amount of rock fragments distribution of plant roots reaction and other features that enable them to identify soils after describing the soils in the survey area and determining their properties the soil scientists assigned the soils to taxonomic classes units taxonomic classes are concepts each taxonomic class has a set of soil characteristics with precisely defined limits the classes are used as a basis for comparison to classify soils systematically soil taxonomy the system of taxonomic classification used in the united states is based mainly on the kind and character of soil properties and the arrangement of horizons within the profile after the soil scientists classified and named the soils in the survey area they compared the individual soils with similar soils in the same taxonomic class in other areas so that they could confirm data and assemble additional data based on experience and research the objective of soil mapping is not to delineate pure map unit components the objective is to separate the landscape into landforms or landform segments that have similar use and management requirements each map unit is defined by a unique combination of soil components andor miscellaneous areas in predictable proportions some components may be highly contrasting to the other components of the map unit the presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the usefulness or accuracy of the data the delineation of such landforms and landform segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of resource plans if intensive use of small areas is planned onsite investigation is needed to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas soil scientists make many field observations in the process of producing a soil map the frequency of observation is dependent upon several factors including scale of mapping intensity of mapping design of map units complexity of the landscape and experience of the soil scientist observations are made to test and refine the soillandscape model and predictions and to verify the classification of the soils at specific locations once the soillandscape model is refined a significantly smaller number of measurements of individual soil properties are made and recorded these measurements may include field measurements such as those for color depth to bedrock and texture and laboratory measurements such as those for content of sand silt clay salt and other components properties of each soil typically vary from one point to another across the landscape observations for map unit components are aggregated to develop ranges of characteristics for the components the aggregated values are presented direct measurements do not exist for every property presented for every map unit component values for some properties are estimated from combinations of other properties while a soil survey is in progress samples of some of the soils in the area generally are collected for laboratory analyses and for engineering tests soil scientists interpret the data from these analyses and tests as well as the fieldobserved characteristics and the soil properties to determine the expected behavior of the soils under different uses interpretations for all of the soils are field tested through observation of the soils in different uses and under different levels of management some interpretations are modified to fit local conditions and some new interpretations are developed to meet local needs data are assembled from other sources such as research information production records and field experience of specialists for example data on crop yields under defined levels of management are assembled from farm records and from field or plot experiments on the same kinds of soil predictions about soil behavior are based not only on soil properties but also on such variables as climate and biological activity soil conditions are predictable over long periods of time but they are not predictable from year to year for example soil scientists can predict with a fairly high degree of accuracy that a given soil will have a high water table within certain depths in most years but they cannot predict that a high water table will always be at a specific level in the soil on a specific date after soil scientists located and identified the significant natural bodies of soil in the survey area they drew the boundaries of these bodies on aerial photographs and custom soil resource report identified each as a specific map unit aerial photographs show trees buildings fields roads and rivers all of which help in locating boundaries accuratelycustom soil resource report soil map the soil map section includes the soil map

interest map unit descriptions the map units delineated on the detailed soil maps in a soil survey represent the soils or miscellaneous areas in the survey area the map unit descriptions along with the maps can be used to determine the composition and properties of a unit a map unit delineation on a soil map represents an area dominated by one or more major kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas a map unit is identified and named according to the taxonomic classification of the dominant soils within a taxonomic class there are precisely defined limits for the properties of the soils on the landscape however the soils are natural phenomena and they have the characteristic variability of all natural phenomena thus the range of some observed properties may extend beyond the limits defined for a taxonomic class areas of soils of a single taxonomic class rarely if ever can be mapped without including areas of other taxonomic classes consequently every map unit is made up of the soils or miscellaneous areas for which it is named and some minor components that belong to taxonomic classes other than those of the major soils most minor soils have properties similar to those of the dominant soil or soils in the map unit and thus they do not affect use and management these are called noncontrasting or similar components they may or may not be mentioned in a particular map unit description other minor components however have properties and behavioral characteristics divergent enough to affect use or to require different management these are called contrasting or dissimilar components they generally are in small areas and could not be mapped separately because of the scale used some small areas of strongly contrasting soils or miscellaneous areas are identified by a special symbol on the maps if included in the database for a given area the contrasting minor components are identified in the map unit descriptions along with some characteristics of each a few areas of minor components may not have been observed and consequently they are not mentioned in the descriptions especially where the pattern was so complex that it was impractical to make enough observations to identify all the soils and miscellaneous areas on the landscapecustom soil resource report the presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the usefulness or accuracy of the data the objective of mapping is not to delineate pure taxonomic classes but rather to separate the landscape into landforms or landform segments that have similar use and management requirements the delineation of such segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of resource plans if intensive use of small areas is planned however onsite investigation is needed to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas an identifying symbol precedes the map unit name in the map unit descriptions each description includes general facts about the unit and gives important soil properties and qualities soils that have profiles that are almost alike make up a soil series except for differences in texture of the surface layer all the soils of a series have major horizons that are similar in composition thickness and arrangement soils of one series can differ in texture of the surface layer slope stoniness salinity degree of erosion and other characteristics that affect their use on the basis of such differences a soil series is divided into soil phases most of the areas shown on the detailed soil maps are phases of soil series the name of a soil phase commonly indicates a feature that affects use or management for example alpha silt loam to percent slopes is a phase of the alpha series some map units are made up of two or more major soils or miscellaneous areas these map units are complexes associations or undifferentiated groups a complex consists of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas in such an intricate pattern or in such small areas that they cannot be shown separately on the maps the pattern and proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all areas alphabeta complex to percent slopes is an example an association is made up of two or more geographically associated soils or miscellaneous areas that are shown as one unit on the maps because of present or anticipated uses of the map units in the survey area it was not considered practical or necessary to map the soils or miscellaneous areas separately the pattern and relative proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar alphabeta association to percent slopes is an example an undifferentiated group is made up of two or more soils or miscellaneous areas that could be mapped individually but are mapped as one unit because similar interpretations can be made for use and management the pattern and proportion of the soils or miscellaneous areas in a mapped area are not uniform an area can be made up of

surface at the base of a hillslope toeslopes in profile are commonly gentle and linear and are constructional surfaces forming the lower part of a hillslope continuum that grades to valley or closeddepression floorscustom soil resource report topsoil the upper part of the soil which is the most favorable material for plant growth it is ordinarily rich in organic matter and is used to topdress roadbanks lawns and land affected by mining trace elements chemical elements for example zinc cobalt manganese copper and iron in soils in extremely small amounts they are essential to plant growth tread the flat to gently sloping topmost laterally extensive slope of terraces flood plain steps or other stepped landforms commonly a recurring part of a series of natural steplike landforms such as successive stream terraces tuff a generic term for any consolidated or cemented deposit that is percent or more volcanic ash upland an informal general term for the higher ground of a region in contrast with a lowlying adjacent area such as a valley or plain or for land at a higher elevation than the flood plain or low stream terrace land above the footslope zone of the hillslope continuum valley fill the unconsolidated sediment deposited by any agent water wind ice or mass wasting so as to fill or partly fill a valley variegation refers to patterns of contrasting colors assumed to be inherited from the parent material rather than to be the result of poor drainage varve a sedimentary layer or a lamina or sequence of laminae deposited in a body of still water within a year specifically a thin pair of graded glaciolacustrine layers seasonally deposited usually by meltwater streams in a glacial lake or other body of still water in front of a glacier very stony spot map symbol a spot where to percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the surrounding soil is covered by less than percent stones water bars smooth shallow ditches or depressional areas that are excavated at an angle across a sloping road they are used to reduce the downward velocity of water and divert it off and away from the road surface water bars can easily be driven over if constructed properlycustom soil resource report weathering all physical disintegration chemical decomposition and biologically induced changes in rocks or other deposits at or near the earths surface by atmospheric or biologic agents or by circulating surface waters but involving essentially no transport of the altered material well graded refers to soil material consisting of coarse grained particles that are well distributed over a wide range in size or diameter such soil normally can be easily increased in density and bearing properties by compaction contrasts with poorly graded soil wet spot map symbol a somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit wilting point or permanent wilting point the moisture content of soil on an ovendry basis at which a plant specifically a sunflower wilts so much that it does not recover when placed in a humid dark chamber windthrow the uprooting and tipping over of trees by the windcustom soil resource report

office fax background the silicon valley berryessa extension project project requires that the contractor submit a construction e missions mitigation plan cemp to the santa clara valley transportation authority vta the purpose of this portion of the cemp is to incorporate specific conditions and implement measure s to reduce diesel particulate matter during project construction during an initial meeting on march the joint venture discussed the cemp mitigation measures from the project technical specification temporary controls air quality with vta as a result of feedback received during the march meeting additional mitigation measures have been addres sed additional measures addressed include the following cemp mitigation measures from project technical specification temporary controls dust control mitigation measures from the best management practice matrix mitigation measures from the mitigation monitoring and reporting program matrix several of the mitigation measures from the areas described above were significantly addressed in the original draft cemp however each mitigation measure from the areas described above related to offroad construction equipment is addressed individually for completeness additionally this most recent update to the cemp addresses comments received from vta on may the measures that were addressed in the initial draft cemp come from the proje ct technical specification temporary controls air quality and include the following equipment shall not idle for more than minutes this requirement has been superseded with a requirement to not idle for more than minutes equipment shall not be tampered with in order to increase engine horsepower equipment shal l include usepa registered particulate traps and other appropriate controls oxidation catalysts and other suitable control devices on all construction equipment used at the construction site and shall use ultralow sulfur diesel fuel ulsd with a sulfur content of parts per million or less or other suitable alternative diesel fuel unless the fuel cannot be reasonably procured in the geographic area equipment shall be tuned to the engine manufacturers specifications in accordance with a defined maintenance schedule suitably of control devices or fuel is based on a number of factors including the following reduced availability of the construction equipment due t o increased downtime andor power output potential for significant damage to equipment engines and any significant risk to nearby workers or the public the cemp shall also establish work limitations such as minimizing trips establishing truck routes and providing staging areas for trucks located away from sensitive receptors and the like the contractor shall include a cost analysis in the draft cemp with respect to the sensitive receptors in the area location of supplies and availability of construction easements near the project ambient air quality monitoring shall be conducted as specified in the environmental clearance documents referenced in technical specifications section environmental requirements and technical specifications section hazardous materials accident prevention procedure beyond the cemp a series of construction mitigation and monitoring requirements are included as a part of the project and are addressed elsewhere mitigation measures addressed include those considered in the bay area air quality management district baaqmd ceqa guidelines most recently updated may the best management practic e matrix and the mitigation monitoring and reporting program matrix measures related to off road construction equipment that will be addressed by the skanska shimmick herzog joint venture are included in attachment demonstration of compliance with miti gation measure s from the project technical specification temporary controls section air quality each of the companies forming the skanska shimmick herzog joint venture has a fleet registered with the california air resources boards carbs in use off road diesel regulation offroad rule because of the general familiarity the joint venture partners have with the off road rule and the alignment between the goals of the cemp and the requirements of the off road rule the off road rule has been utilized as a guidance document in developing the cemp as a result when developing the cemp the joint venture considered equipment subject to the off road rule this approach will assure that diesel particulate matter emissions from constr uction equipment will be mitigated to an equal or greater extent than specified in the mitigation measures and best management practices air quality mitigation measures and best management practices related to off road construction equipment are addresse d below mitigation measure equipment shall not idle for more than minutes superseded with a requirement to not idle equipment for more than minutes the idling restrictions specified in the off road rule are already in effect and are enforceable by carb and local air districts as a result no vehicle or engines subject to the off road rule may idle for more than consecutive minutes the project mitigation requirements go beyond the requirements of the off road rule allow ing idling for no more than consecutive minutes the idling limit does not apply to idling when queuing idling to verify that the vehicle is in safe operating condition idling for testing servicing repairing or diagnostic purposes idling necessary to accomplish work for which the vehicle was designed such as operating a crane idling required to bring the machine system to operating temperature and idling necessary to ensure safe operation of the vehicle as of march medium and large f leets must also have a written idling policy that is made available to operators of the vehicles and informs them that idling is limited to consecutive minutes or less each member of the joint venture has a written idling policy for the purpose of this project the minute idling limit will be replaced with a minute idling limit limiting idling to less than minutes and compliance with the off road rule idling restrictions will accomplish the mitigation proposed by mitigation measure mitigation measure equipment shall not be tampered with to increase engine horsepower each member of the joint venture maintains its off road equipment according to manufacturers specifications which generally prohibits the tampering mitigation measu re attempts to address the joint venture hereby certifies that equipment shall not be tampered with to increase engine horsepower mitigation measure equipment shall include usepa registered particulate traps and other appropriate controls oxidat ion catalysts and other suitable control devices on all construction equipment used at the construction site and shall use ultra low sulfur diesel fuel ulsd with a sulfur content of parts per million or less or other suitable alternative diesel fue l unless the fuel cannot be reasonably procured in the geographic area diesel fuel with a sulfur content of parts per million or less is readily available and will be utilized in all diesel fueled equipment subject to the cemp while mitigation meas ure incorporates usepa registered particulate traps and envisions other controls it does not include any reference to the use of newer engine technology this could result in the unintended consequence of higher diesel particulate matter emissions and could potentially run afoul of a recent ruling from the state of californias occupational safety and health standards board related to the safety of vehicle exhaust retrofits the joint venture proposes to meet the goals outlined in mitigation measure through the use of equipment with tier or newer engine technology justification for this proposed alternative is described in the balance of this section epas verified retrofit technologies list wwwepagovcleandieselverificationverif

emissions nox emission factors for off road diesel engines gbhp hr horsepower ranges tier tier from an emissions perspective use of tier or newer engines for equipment subject to the off road rule is clearly superior to the use of tier engines controlled using diesel oxidation catalysts which is allowed under mitigation measure in addit ion to the benefits described above the use of tier or newer engines would produce fewer greenhouse gas ghg emissions than tier engines with diesel oxidation catalysts tier engines have better fuel economy than their tier counterparts resulti ng in lesser generation of ghgs additionally diesel oxidation catalysts convert carbon monoxide co to carbon dioxide co resulting in increased emissions of ghgs in addition to the emission benefits associated with the use of tier engines as compared to tier engines with diesel oxidation catalysts the joint venture is concerned that forced installation of exhaust retrofit devices will cause a compliance confli ct with the requirements of the state of californias occupational safety and health standards board standards board at their december meeting the standards board approved a safety order related to the installation of exhaust retrofits on con struction equipment a copy of the recently approved standard is included as attachment to this cemp this new standard places strict limitations related to visibility on the installation of the exhaust retrofit devices that would be required by mitiga tion measure the joint venture is concerned that a requirement to install exhaust retrofit devices would create a violation of this new standard as a result of the issues related to mitigation measure the joint venture proposes a substitute requirement specifying compliance with carbs offroad rule and the use of tier or newer engines in off road equipment this substitute requirement would equal or exceed the benefits associated with the current version of mitigation measure a sample list of off

as a technical expert to the construction industry air quality coaliti on ciaqc and the associated general contractors of america agc as these associations worked to reach an agreement with carb to amend the off road equipment rule to its current version at their december board meeting carb significantly amended t he off road equipment rule significant changes included the following a four year delay from the original timeline for all fleets making the first compliance deadline january for large fleets over hp january for medium fleets hp and january for small fleets hp or less a dramatic reduction and simplification in the annual requirements for fleets and fleet average structure fleets now have only one fleet average target to meet based on their n ox emissions if they cannot meet the fleet average target they are required to clean up to percent of their horsepower annually as opposed to the previous requirement of to percent removing diesel particulate matter reduction requirements f rom the rule completely making exhaust retrofits no longer mandatory a fact sheet summarizing the changes adopted at the december carb board meeting are included as attachment the entire staff report related to the rule amendment can be access ed at httpwwwarbcagovregactoffroadlsioffroadlsihtm the december amendments were essentially the result of two things first a realization that the economy was both preventing fleets from being able to spend money on new equipment and resulting in emission reductions second the discovery that the off road equipment nox and diesel pm emission inventories used during the initial rule development were grossly overestimated the nox and diesel pm emission inventories in the initial rulemaking were overstated by approximately two articles written just shortly after carb announced these changes to the off road equipment rule are also presented in attachment the four year delay in the start of the off road equipment rule combined with the timing of the epacarb requirements for engineequipment manufacturers to bring newer tiered engines to market and the current economic malaise have somewh at altered the equipment availability for newer tiered machines for example beginning in engine and equipment manufacturers were required to begin producing tier interim engines for any engine rated at horsepower hp or greater engines in the hp to hp range transitioned from tier to tier interim while engines hp and larger jumped from tier to tier interim in addition to the slow economy keeping brand new tier and tier equipment from being sold engine manufacturers are allowed to use credits to continue to sell tier and tier equipment as tier interim compliant for an ex tended period of time beyond the date of

for work is not automatically inserted into the work queue first the work needs to be justified and approved considerations must be made to determine the overall condition of the unit and future plans for maintenance and replacement in some instances the repairs may be deferred and the unit replaced as opposed to spen ding resources on an unneeded unit if the request is for emergency maintenance considerations must be made to determine if there are viable temporary measures which may be taken to avoid a project schedule impact additionally the legitimacy of claims and the availability of

offroad diesel vehicle regulation compliance requirements summary on july the california air resources boar d arb approved and subsequently adopted a regulation to reduce diesel particulate matter pm and oxides of nitrogen nox emissions from inuse existing offroad heavyduty diesel vehicles in california at its december hearing the board considered and made findings on the need for amendments to the regulation this fact sheet describes the december amendments for general inform ation about the regulation see the offroad regulation knowledge center at httpwwwarbcagovmsprogordieselknowcenterhtm who must comply with the offroad regulation any person business or government agency that owns or operates dieselpowered offroad vehicles in california except for agricultural or personal use or for use at ports or intermodal railyards with engines with maximum power of horsepower hp or great er are subject to the regulation the regulation applies to vehicles commonly used in construction mining rental airport ground support and other industries outofstate companies doing business in california are also subject to the regulation what types of vehicles are subject to the offroad regulation the regulation applies to selfpropelled dieselfueled v ehicles that cannot be registered and licensed to drive onroad as well as twoengine vehicles that driv e onroad with the limited exception of twoengine sweepers examples include loader s crawler tractors skid steers backhoes forklifts airport ground support equipment water well drilling rigs and twoengine cranes the regulation does not apply to stationary equipment or portabl e equipment such as generators what changes to the offroad regulation do the december amendments include a four year delay from the original timeline fo r all fleets making the first compliance deadline january for large fleets over hp january for medium fleets hp and january for small fleets hp or less a dramatic reduction and simplification in the annual requirements for fleets and fleet average structure fleets now have only one fleet average target to meet based on their nox emissions if they cannot meet the fleet av erage target they are required to clean up to percent of their horsepower annually as opposed to the previous requirement of to percent making exhaust retrofits no longer mandatory raising the low use threshold to hours per year instead of hours overall staff estimates that these amendments re duce the compliance costs by more than percent during the first five years and more than percent during the entire span of the regulation compared to the regulation before the amendments what do i need to do now the offroad regulation as initially adopted requires reporting and labeling limits unnecessary idling and requires disclosure of the regulatio n upon vehicle sale these requirements are not affected by the december amendments and enforcement actions for these requirements are ongoing with fines of up to per day possible for each vehicle that is in violation if a fleet has not done so already it should report a ll applicable vehicles to arb as soon as possible and label its vehicles appropriately fleets should also comply with the fiveminute idling limit and maintain a the board delegated to the arb executive officer responsibility to complete the regulatory process and make a final determination on whether the amendments should be adopted california environmental protection agency air resources board written idling policy as required when selling an a ffected vehicle the seller should notify the vehicle buyer of the regulation although the december amendments include a signifi cant delay of the regulations first compliance dates planning now could reduce or spread out future compliance costs fleets could earn credit for taking early actions to reduce emissions such as repowering or replacing their older dirtier vehicles and installing exhaust retrofits what reporting and labeling does the regulation require the regulation required fleets to initially report all applicable vehicles to arb in after reporting fleets had to label their vehicles with the equipment identification numbers eins assigned by arb after the initial reporting and labeling fleets must r eport any additions to their fleet or retirements from their fleet within days fleets must also submit annual guarantees that they are in compliance on march large fleets must submit such affirmati ons each year through medium fleets each year from and small fleets each year from for more information on reporting please call doors what limits does the regulation place on idling vehicles subject to this regulation may not idle for more than five consecutive minutes however the idling limit does not apply to necessary idling such as idling to verify that a vehicle is in safe operating condition for testing serving repairing or diagno stic purposes or to accomplish work for which the vehicle was designed medium and large fleets are also required to have a written idling policy made available to the operators of the vehicles that informs them of this fiveminute idling limit what are the offroad regulations performance requirements and when do they take effect the offroad regulations performanc e requirements are based on a fleet s average nox emissions if a fleet cannot meet the nox fleet average target it must comply with the regulations best available control technology bact requirements by cleaning up to per cent of its fleet each year it cannot meet the target a fleet may satisfy the bact requirements eit her by turnover or applying exhaust retrofits under the december amendments the performance requirements would take effect on january for large fleets january for medium fleets and january for small fleets the performance requirements continue every year thr ough january for large and medium fleets and january for small fleets does the offroad regulation require installing exhaust retrofits no under the december amendments fleets will be able to comply with the performance requirements of the offroad regulation solely through tu rning over or repowering their vehicles however retrofitting may be your lowest cost compliance option applying exhaust retrofits can help fleets meet the fleet average targets and comply with the annual bact requirements retrofits installed early can earn double credit and exempt a vehicle from further actions for the life of the regulation am i exempt from the regulation if i onl y have one or two offroad vehicles no but a new compliance option will make it easier to comply fleets with hor sepower or less will be able to comply by simply phasing out their ol dest dirtiest vehicles starting in where can i find more information about the offroad regulation additional information and other fact sheets are available at wwwarbcagovordiesel or by calling arbs diesel hotline at diesel california formally proposes sweeping amendments to controversial rule on offroad diesel emissions november consistent with its prior agreement with agc the california air resources board carb or board has formally proposed a series of sweeping amendmen ts to its controversia l rule on offroad diesel emissions the amendments will push the original de adlines for construction contractors and other fleet owners to meet the rules emission standards andor turnover requirements back a total of four years they will also cut the percentage of the total horsep ower that the rule requires construction contractors and other fleet owners to turn over ie retire repower rebuild retrofit or declared to be low use in any one year and they will expand an existing exemption for lowuse vehicles the amendments will be out for public comment for a period of days at the close of that period on either the first or the second day of the twoday m eeting that the board has scheduled for middecember the amendments will go back to the board for its final approval when it proposed the rule carb estimated that th e total cost of compliance would be somewhere between and billion carb now estimates that the cost would only be billion nevertheless it also estimates that the amendments to the original rule will still save the regulated fleets billion the construction industrys original es timate of the total cost of compliance was close to billion and if that number was anywhere close to accurate then the amendments to the rule will actually save far more and that is just in california agc believes that approximately other states may well have interest in adopting the california rule if they succeeded in doi ng so in accordance with the federal clean air act then the total savings to the construction industry would be even greater these amendments are the direct result of agcs succ ess in challenging the emissions inventory that formed the foundation for the original rule in after several years of frequently intense debate the board came to agree that its original estimates of the emissions from the regulated fleets were far too high and changes were in order to its credit however the board has now acknowledged its mistake and begun the process of amending the rule i background carb adopted the rule in july of and as a matter of california law the rule took effect in june of carb could not however enforce the emission standards included in the rule or the related requirements for the turnover of existing equipmen t until the us environmental protection agency epa approved of those standards carb sought epas approval in august of but agc strongly objected and in response epa has delaye d any decision and carb has remained without the authority to enforce the standards or turnover requirements the rule seeks to reduce emissions of both partic ulate matter pm and nitrogen oxides nox from existing fleets offroad diesel equipment primarily in the c onstruction industry to th at end the rule gives construction contractors and other fleet owners two set s of steadily declining emission standards one for pm and the other for nox each year the regulated fleet s have to either meet the standards or turn over a certain percentage of their horsepower the rule also imposes recordkeeping reporting and labeling requirements and restricts idling time ii major amendments as noted the amendments are sweeping they will ch ange the rule in fundamental ways redirecting its various incentives and requirements in sum the amendments will reduce the incentives and limit the requirements for reducing pm emissions but maintain and in later years increase the incentives and requirements for reducing nox emissions among the very basic changes that are now on the table is a change in the accounting year for the rules various incentives and requirements currently that year runs from march of each year to the end of the following february the amendments will change th at year to run from january of each year to the end of the following december bringing the accounti ng year for the rule into line with the calendar year the amendments will also change the a nnual reporting deadline for all fleets to march following is a brief summary of the other major changes to the rule deadlines for meeting emission targets the amendments will push the deadlines for large over hp medium between and hp and sm all under hp fleets to meet the rules emission standards andor turnover requirements back a total of four years the changes to the first of the deadlines will be these large fleets from march of to january of medium fleets from march of january of small fleets from march to january and the changes to the fi nal deadlines will be these large fleets from march of to january of medium fleets from march of to january of small fleets from march of to january of number and level of emission standards the amendments will delete the pm emission standards included in the original rule and leav e it to the remaining standards to drive future reductions of both pm and nox emissions for the first three years the new emission standa rds will be the same as the nox emission standards included in the original rule in later years the emission standards will fall farther and faster but in the final year the standards will still be tier equivalent to the standards in the original rule in other words if a fleet consisted of a single vehicle and that vehicle met the final standards in the current rule that vehicle would still meet the final standards in the amended rule turnover requirements like the original rule the amended rule will require fleets to turn over ie retire repower rebuild retrofit or declared to be low use a certain percentage of their total horsepower in any year in which they fail to meet their emission standards the amendments will however make dramatic cuts in the percentage of the horsepower that fleets may have to turn over in any one year several amendments will have the ne t effect of reducing the percentage of the total horsepower that large fleets will have to turn over in any one year in the following ways year one down from to years two and three down from to years four and five down from a minimum of to all subsequent years down from to though the amended rule will give greater weight to reducing nox emissions it will also seek to reduce pm emissions and for that reason pm retr ofits will count toward the turnover requirements included in the amended rule early action credits the amendments will make se veral changes to the early action credits that construction contractors and other fleet owners will retain and may accumulate in the future these changes will include the following the amendments will entitle fleets to retain their early retirement credits for any reductions in their total horsepower between march of and march of but cut those credits by to account for the more dramatic drop in th e turnover requirements and provide that fleets may not use to such credits in when califor nia will have to undertake its next round of ambient air quality testing the amendments will enable fleets to earn reduced horsepower credits for reducing their total horsepower between march of and fe bruary of and those credits will be full credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in the amendments will entitle fleets to retain any early repower credits they earned under the original rule for repowering tier vehicles equi pment to a higher tier by march of and those credits will be full credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in the amendments will enable fleets to earn repower and rebuild credits in the future for repowering or rebuilding their tier and tier e quipment to a tier or higher standard by the following deadlines and those credits will be full credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in large fleets january of medium fleets january of small fleets january of the amendments will entitle fleets to retain any early replacement credits that they earned under the original rule for replacing tier equi pment between march of and march of in accordance with the formula included in the original rule and those credits will be full credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in the amendment will entitle fleets to earn early replacement credits in the future in accordance with the similar formula included in th e amended rule for replacing tier and tier equipment during the following periods and those credits will be full credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in large fleets between march of and december of medium fleets between march of and december of small fleets between march of and december of the amendments will entitle fleets to retain any early retrofit credits that they earned under the original rule for applying verified diesel emission control strategies vdecs to their equipment by january of and those credits will remain double credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in the amendments will enable fleets to earn early retrofit credits in the future by applying either pm or nox vdecs to their equipment by the following deadlines and those credits will also be double credits unreduced by any amount and available for fleets to use in large fleets january of medium fleets january of small fleets january of reduced activity credits while the amended rule will retain and even extend the early action credits included in the original rule the amended rule will omit the reduced activity credits similarly included in the rule when questioned about this change carb has respo nded that it inserted the reduced activity credits into the rule for the limited purpose of providing re lief to large fleets in and now that carb is pushing the first of the deadlines for larg e fleets to meet the emission standards andor turnover requirements back to carb maintains that it is already providing more relief than the reduced activity credits were intended to provide exemption from requirements to reward the large fleets that made a serious effort to meet the turnover and retrofit requirements included in th e original rule the amendments will exempt large fleets from the emission standards and turnover requirements if the following taken together equaled or exceeded of such fleets total horsepower as of march of early retirement credits redu ced in accordance with other amen dments to the rule for any reductions in total horsepower between march of and march of early repower credits for any vehicles repower ed from tier to a higher tier by march of early replacement credits for any tier vehi cles replaced between marc h of and march of in accordance with the form ula included in the original rule early retrofit credits for applying either pm or nox vdecs to equipment by january of any turnover credits earned between march of and february of except to the extent that they include early retrofit credits while the early retirement credits that count to ward the exemption will be reduced in accordance with other amendments to the rule counti ng such credits toward the exemption will not have the effect of reducing the early retirement credits av ailable to fleets in the future the amendments make it clear that this particular provision will not have the effect of reducing any credit that any fleet would otherwise have the right to use in or any subsequent year exemption for lowuse vehicles the amendments will double the number of hours that vehicles may operate in any one year and still qualify for speci al treatment as lowuse vehicles the current limit is the amendments will increase that number to in addition they will clarify the differences between yearbyyear lowuse vehicl es and permanent lowuse vehicles and the benefits of fitting a vehicle into either category restrictions on adding vehicles the amendments will change the deadlines for regulated fleets to add tier tier and tier equipment first they will extend the deadline for adding tier equipment from march of to the date on which epa finally approves the offroad rule a nd grants carb the authority to enforce its emission standards second they will delete the complex provisi on that generally prohibits fleets from adding tier equipment in any year in which they fail to meet their pm emission targets and replace it with the following large and medium fleets may not add tier equipment after march of unless that equipment has an ein number that carb assigned to the equipment prior to that same date large and medium fleets may not add any ti er equipment after january of small fleets may not add any tier equipment after january of finally the amendments will make the fo llowing changes to the deadlines for adding tier equipment for large and medium fleets the deadline will m ove up from march of to january of for small fleets the deadline will move up fro m march of to january of whether on balance the new restrictions on adding tier tier and tier equipment are more or less stringent than the current restrictions remains a close question it is however clear that the new restrictions are less stringent than the restricti ons that carb workshopped in june and september of in advance of making any formal proposal to amend the rule flex engines the amendments will delete the special provision that now requires fleets to treat post flexibly engines differently from other engines of the same tier the current rule requires such engines to be flexed back to the sta ndard to which they are certified in september carb informally proposed a less complex but still pun itive provision that woul d have required fleets to treat all such engines as if they were one tie r less the amendments now on the table will simply delete the special provision on flex engines and pr ovide that the emission factors for such engines are the same as the emission factors for all other engines of the same tier iv conclusion other amendments to the rule would clarify th e requirements for new fleets create a new and much more streamlined option for fleets with or less horsepower provide that vehicles exempt from the turnover requirements between the first and fi nal deadlines will remain exempt in the years that follow when fleets that do not meet the final emissi on standards will have to continue to turn over equipment and require labeling on both sides of each vehicle depending on its individual circumstances any one fleet may find these or other changes to the rule to be more significant than the several summarized here agc advises and encourages everyone subject to the rule to review it carefully and if necessary to seek professional assistance in coming into compliance the board will conduct a public hearing on the amendmen ts in sacramento on december or and at the close of that hearing agc of america expects the board to vote on the amendments including any and further changes that the board staff may recommend on the day of the hearing agc also urges all of the california contractors interested in ensuring that the board approves the amendments to attend that hearing and to express their support for the amendmen ts carb will be posting the exact date of the hearing whether december or and other detail s on its web site no later than december bolsa chica street suite huntington beach ca office

a one and one half pollutant rule no x particulate matter is voluntary designed to deal with two problems pm and ozone did you get all of that probably not but at least now youll have a little more time to figure it all out on december and the california air re sources board arb will conduct a hearing in sacramento to consider sweeping changes to the of froad diesel rule these proposed amendments depart from the incremental changes weve seen si nce the rule was initially adopted in july in favor of significant relief for recessionravaged c ontractors here are a few of the headlines initial compliance dates delayed large fleets those with greater than horse power will have their in itial compliance date pushed back from march to january additionally the requirements will not apply to fleets that completed the equipment turnover andor retrofits necessary to comply with the original requirements medium fleets those with to horsepower will now have an in itial compliance date of january instead of march small fleets those with horse power or less will now have an initial compliance date of january small fleets were previously scheduled to begin complying with the pm provisions rule on march small fleets will now have to consider no x instead of pm but thats because nobody will be required to install retrofit devices to contro l pm you can still install them and get credit for it in the rule if you want to mandatory pm rule requirements completely eliminated the proposed rule no longer requires contractor s to install verified diesel emission control strategies vdecs to control di esel pm contractors who have previously installed vdecs or who wish to do so voluntarily in the future will continue to recei ve credit for these actions no x fleet average and best available control t echnology bact requirements will remain in place until january for large and medium fleets and january for small fleets the enddate fleet average targ ets are more stringent than those in th e previous rule as a result at the end of the compliance period th ere will be somewhat more ti er interim and tier final equipment required than under the previous rule bact requirements modified fleets that do not meet the new no x fleet average targets need to turn over equipment or apply the highest level pm vdecs to the following percentages of total fleet horsepower to to the small fleet bact requirement is from credit provisions altered arb giveth and arb taketh away for contr actors who received ab x reduced activity credits you should be aware that they have been e liminated and cannot be used at any point early retirement credits will be reduced by percent a nd cannot be used to offs et bact requirements for the compliance date they can be used beyond however the doublecredit for installation of vdecs had been ex tended large fleets that insta ll vdecs before january receive doublecredit medium fleets will have until december and small fleets will have until december lowuse threshold increased long a point of contention arb has finally raised the threshold for a mach ine to qualify as low use from hours annually to hours annually additional compliance option for microfleets fleets with horsepower or less have a new compliance option if th ey want to forget about fleet average targets and bact requirements instead of these first two compliance options micro fleets can choose to have a certain percentage of their horsepower at a tier or higher level according to the following schedule optional compliance schedule for fleet s with horsepower or less compliance year percent of fleet by horsepower which must be tier or higher requirements for addi ng vehicles relaxed the ban on adding tier equipment will not become effective until the us epa issues a waiver for the offroad rule bans on adding tier and ti er equipment will be implemented according to the following schedule ban on adding tier and tier engines engine tier large medium fleet ban on addition small fleet ban on addition tier january january tier january january miscellaneous changes a few additional changes have been made notable amongst them the penalty for owning a flex engine has been removed all captive attainment fleets will be subject to the small fleet requirements regardless of their total horsepower labeling requirements have changed and will co st more equipment identification numbers eins must now be placed on both sides of each piece of equipment captive area attainment fleets eins must be changed to white letter s on a green background for equipment that has already been registered the second ein for all fleets as well as the replacement eins for captive attainment fleets must be in place by january new large and medium fleets ente ring california for the first time must be in compliance with the closest future large fleet average target upon entry into th e state new small fleets entering the state after the effective date of the amendments must meet the closest future small fleet average target upon entry the marked up version of the offroad rule covers pages and is available here httpwwwarbcagovregact offroadlsioffroadappapdf there are certain to be a number of gremlins in the rule language given the last minute rush to get the proposed changes to the arb governing board in decem ber changes can still be made leading up to the hearing so if you see something that doesnt se em quite right contact a ny of us at associates environmental you can find our contact information at

agroforestry carbon sequestration rates green earth appeal httpsgreenearthappealorgcoverification agroforestry carbon sequestration rates executive summary at the green earth appeal we are planting trees in tropical climates along with the provision of tools education and infrastructure to provide aidreliant communities with sustainable and profitable agroforestry farming businesses now and for generations to come as well as helping end poverty the trees we plant have another significant benefit to our planet through the process of photosynthesis trees absorb co and push it down through their root system where it remains harmless beneath the groundin summary whilst the carbon sequestration rates are lower in cooler climates in the projects that green earth appeal funds research and evidence demonstrates that in a tropical climate a tree will sequester a minimum of around kg of co per year for a useful life span of years ie kg per tree planted in its year useful lifetime carbon sequestration by burning fossil fuels and destroying forests we are releasing dangerous and harmful greenhouse gases importantly carbon dioxide co into the atmosphere these heattrapping gases are warming the planet resulting in changes that are taking us outside the climate bounds within which civilisation as we know it developed last year a report by the une found that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed parts per million ppm its highest level since the pliocene epoch million years ago human activities in the meanwhile fromthese carbonsensitive farming and land management practices can produce a huge increase in the number of tons of carbon sequestered per year while also improving fertility raising food output and reducing soil erosion further research into sequestration rates was carried out by dexter dombro ceo of amazonia reforestation his studies backed up by science daily state that natural african tropical forests absorb approximately kg lbs of carbon per hectare per year if you take kg by times more wood per hectare in a plantation setting the result is kg lbs per hectare per year divided home united nations how we help where we help apply for grant contact agroforestry carbon sequestration rates green earth appeal httpsgreenearthappealorgcoverification driving fossil fuel burning cars to burning coal are increasing this ppm by roughly ppm a year studies over the last thirty years have shown variance in the amount of carbon that trees sequester however recently environmental analyst lester r brown the man considered one of the great pioneer environmentalists studied this field in depth and realised sustainable development and in particular reforestation and afforestation in his book time for plan lester r brown founder of the world watch institute and former president of the earth policy institute said that whilst deforestation has already been banned in some areas to moderate flooding stabilize soils and prevent erosion the worlds remaining forests store massive amounts of carbon therefore the need for forest protection now goes beyond that of local environmental protection to global climate protection his research showed that a newly planted tree in the tropics can remove up to kilograms of co from the atmosphere each year during its growth period of years on the other hand a tree in the temperate regions can take in kilograms additional carbon can be sequestered through improved agricultural land management this includes expanding the area of minimum or notill cropland planting more cover crops during the offseason and using more perennials instead of annuals in cropping patternsby plantation trees per hectare which results in an average of kg lbs of carbon sequestered per tree per year another study carried out by myers and goreau showed that tropical tree plantations of pine and eucalyptus can sequester an average of tons of carbon per hectare per year therefore the plantation can sequester an average of lbs lbs cohayear or taking an average of trees per hectare kg or lbs cotreeyear the amount of co a tree sequesters varies based on the growth rate age and species of the particular tree young quickly growing trees uptake significantly more carbon than mature trees with a slower growth rate warm and wet climates with long growing seasons also contribute to rapid plant growth and indirectly promote higher rates of carbon sequestration the age of the forest plays a role as well a recent study in found that new rainforests grown on land considered to be degraded known as secondary forests are capable of storing up to times more carbon than oldgrowth rainforests where tree growth has largely plateaued this is backed up by a report by the fao conclusion in summary whilst the carbon sequestration rates are lower in cooler climates in the projects that green earth appeal funds research and evidence from the une the fao and scientists and environmentalist from around the globe all point to the fact that in a tropical climate a tree will sequester a minimum of around kg of co per year for a useful life span of years ie kg per tree planted in its year useful

bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir greenhouse gas emissions introduction the feir and seir considered greenhouse gas ghg emissions within section of each document the feir described the sources of ghgs and the effect of ghg emissions on the atmosphere the seir concluded that the feir information remained accurate and did not update the ghg discussion since publication of the seir the bay area air quality management district baaqmd has published new guidance for assessing climate change and ghg emissions in environmental documents the new guidance includes a summary of recent regulations and a quantitative threshold for assessing impac ts baaqmd california environmental quality act air quality guidelines june additionally the ceqa guidelines have been amended to require an evaluation of ghg emissions updates to the ceqa guidelines codified in march require lead agencies to consider the potential for a project to result in significant emissions of ghgs the updated ceqa guidelines further state that one of the factors that lead agencies should consider in determining the significance of a projects ghg emissions is whether the projects anticipated emissions would comply with pertinent regulations thus this section includes a comprehensive discussion of ghg regulations and ghg emission impacts this section serves as a stand alone technical section that entirely replaces the ghg discussions in both the feir and seir environmental settin g unlike emissions of criteria and toxic air pollutants which have local or regional impacts emissions of ghgs that contribute to global warming or global climate change have a broader global impact global warming is a process whereby ghgs accumulating in the atmosphere contribute to an increase in the temperature of the earths atmosphere the principal ghgs contributing to global warming are carbon dioxide co methane ch nitrous oxide n o and fluorinated compounds these gases allow visible and ultraviolet light from the sun to pass through the atmosphere but they prevent heat from escaping back into space among the potential implications of global warming are rising sea levels and adverse effects to water supply water quality agriculture forestry and habitats in addition global warming may increase electricity demand for cooling decrease the availability of hydroelectric power and affect regional air quality and public health like most criteria and toxic air pollutants much of the ghg production comes from motor vehicles environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir in addition to co ch and n o ghgs include hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs sulfur hexafluoride sf and water vapor of all the ghgs co is the most abundant pollutant that contributes to climate change through fossil fuel combustion co accounts for approximately percent of the total ghg emissions in california in addition a number of human made pollutants such as carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides non methane volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide so have indirect effects on terrestrial or solar radiation absorption by influencing the formation or destruction of other climate change emissions carbon dioxide equivalent co e is a measurement used to account for the fact that different ghgs have different potential to retain infrared radiation in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect this potential known as the global warming potential of a ghg is dependent on the lifetime or persistence of the gas molecule in the atmosphere for example ton of ch has the same contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately tons of co and ton of no has the same contribution to the greenhouse effect as approximately tons of co therefore ch and n o are much more potent ghg s than co expressing emissions in co e takes into consideration the contributions of all ghg emissions to the greenhouse effect regulatory setting federal greenhouse gas regulations supreme court ruling the united states environmental protection agency usepa is the f ederal agency responsible for implementing the clean air act caa in april the us supreme court ruled that co is an air pollutan t as defined under the caa and that the usepa has the authority to regulate emissions of ghgs us supreme court massachusetts et al v environmental protection agency et al us april epa actions in response to the mounting issue of climate change the usepa has taken actions to regulate monitor and potentially reduce ghg emissions mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule on september the usepa issued a final rule for mandatory reporting of ghgs from large ghg emissions sources in the united states in general this national reporting requirement will provide the usepa with accurate and timely ghg emissions data from facilities that emit metric tons or more of environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir co per year this publically available data will allow reporters to track their own emissions compare them to similar facilities and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future reporting is generally at the facility level however certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases along with vehicle and engine manufacturers will report at the corporate level an estimated percent of total us ghg emissions from approximately facilities is covered by this final rule proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under the clean air act in april the usepa published its endan germent finding in the federal register the endangerment finding is based on section a of the caa which states that the a dministrator of the usepa should regulate and develop standards for emissions of air pollution from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines which in its judgment cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare the proposed rule addresses section a in two distinct findings the first addresses whether or not the concentrations of the six key ghgs ie co ch no hfcs pfcs and sf in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations the second addresses whether or not the combined emissions of ghgs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to atmospheric concentrations of ghgs and therefore the threat of climate change usepa proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under the climate change act april the administr ator proposed the finding that atmospheric concentrations of ghgs endanger the public health and welfare within the meaning of section a of the climate change act the evidence supporting this finding consists of human activity resulting in high atm ospheric levels of ghg emissions which are very likely responsible for increases in average temperatures and other climatic changes furthermore the observed and projected results of climate change eg higher likelihood of heat waves wild fires droughts sea level rise and higher intensity storms are a threat to the public health and welfare therefore ghgs were found to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations the administrator also proposed the finding that ghg emissions from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution which is endangering public health and welfare the proposed finding cites that in motor vehicles were the second largest contributor to domestic ghg emissions percent of total behind electricity generation and that in the us was environmental analysis greenhouse gas emissions bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir responsible for percent of global ghg emissions therefore ghg emissions from motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines were found to contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare state greenhouse gas regulations assembly bill in then governor gray davis signed assembly bill ab ab requires that the california air resources board c arb develop and adopt by january regulations that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases emitted by passenger vehicles and light duty trucks and other vehicles determined by the california air resources board to be vehicles whose primary use is noncommercial personal transportation in the state to meet the requirements of ab in c arb approved amendments to the california code of regulations ccr adding ghg emissions standards to californias existing standards for motor vehicle emissions amendments to ccr title sections and ccr and adoption of section ccr require automobile manufacturers to meet fleet average ghg emissions limits for all passenger cars light duty trucks within various weight criteria and medium duty passenger vehicle weight classes ie any medium duty vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating less than pounds that is designed primarily for the transportation of persons beginning with the model yea r for passenger cars and light duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight lvw of pounds or less the ghg emission limits for the model year are approximately percent lower than the limits for the first year of the regulations the model year for light duty trucks wi th a lvw of pounds to gross vehicle weight of pounds as well as medium duty passenger vehicles ghg emissions would be reduced approximately percent between and in december a group of car dealerships automobile manufacturers and trade groups representing automobile manufacturers filed suit against ca rb to prevent enforcement of ccr sections and as amended by ab

demand forecasts hexagon transportation consultants inc february environmental analysis transportation bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir travel time between selected origin destination pairs one of the key objectives for the svrtc is to reduce transit travel times because travel time is a key factor in mode choice decisions eg using an automobile versus public transit traffic congestion and

table presents a comparison of total door todoor auto shared ride and transit travel times between nine selected origins and either of three selected destinations nine origin destination pairs in the

source travel demand forecasts hexagon transportation consultants inc february and august auto travel times show negligible improvement for many origin destination pairs under the project the average auto travel time savings for both drive alone and shared ride modes for all origin destination pairs would remain virtually unchanged compared to no project conditions this is due in part to the projected increase in freeway traffic congestion and resulting poor level of environmental analysis transportation bart silicon valley nd supplemental eir service that would occur by under both the no project conditions and phase see subs ection of this seir for a summary of roadway conditions forecasted for roadway congestion would in theory lessen if phase diverted a substantial volume of auto trips to transit however on svrtc freeways the shifted volumes tend to be immediately replaced by autos that had diverted to other roadways because peak hour fr eeway demand exceeds available capacities under both the no project and phase the roadway network tends to reach equilibrium under both alternatives which results in freeway operations almost always at capacity conclusion overall transit ridership in the svrtc would increase under phase some of this growth would be diverted ridership from other transit modes reducing their growth in increase in transit trips in svrtc total

purpose and need chapter purpose and need background the federal transit administration fta and santa c l ara valley transportation authority vta have prepared this environmental impact statement eis in accordance with the national environmental policy act nepa the eis has been developed for three alternatives the silicon valley rapid transit project svrtp alternative the berryessa extension project bep alternative and the no build alternative in the silicon valley rapid transit corridor svrtc the bay area rapid transit bart network that serves the san francisco bay area counties of alameda contra costa san francisco and san mateo is a mile station regional rail system that currently extends south to central fremont in alameda county a mile extension of that line to southern fremont warm springs extension just north of the santa clara county limit will begin construction in and revenue operations in see figure bart system map the svrtp alternative would continue the bart alignment into santa clara county for approximately miles and provide six stations the bep alternative to be evaluated under the ftas new starts program would be a mile twostation extension of bart a no build alternative also has been formulated as a basis for comparison to the other alternatives a detailed description of the no build alternative bep alternative and svrtp alternative is provided in chapter alternatives transit improvements are intended to expand mobility options for santa clara county and bay area residents and help address serious transportation needs that will only become more critical as the region continues to grow both in population and employment these improvements would provide a new link in the regional rail network and direct access to the central business district of the regions largest city san jose and into the core employment areas of silicon valley see figure silicon valley rapid transit corridor silicon valleyeconomic engine of the san f rancisco bay area the reference to santa clara county as silicon valley purportedly first occurred in the name refers to the element silicon that emerged as the key material in making solid state transistors which had replaced vacuum tubes and their applications in most electronics various industries and a multitude of firms had emerged during the late s and s to research and apply this new technology silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis purpose and need purpose and need for project the overall project goal of a major transit improveme nt in the svrtc is to improve transit services and increase intermodal connectivity thereby improving mobility and accessibility meeting this overall project purpose would address a variety of related transportation needs in the svrtc and benefit major portions of the bay area purpose of proposed transportation improvements the project is intended to achieve the following objectives improve public transit service in this severely cong ested corridor by providing increased transit capacity and faster convenient access to and from major santa clara county employment and activity centers for corridor residents and residents from throughout the bay area and portions of the central valley of california enhance regional connectivity by expanding and inter connecting bart rapid transit service with vta light rail amtrak ace caltrain and vta bus services in santa clara county improve intermodal transit hubs where rail bus auto bicycle and pedestrian links meet increase transit ridership by expanding modal option s in a corridor with ever increasing travel demand that cannot be accommodated by existing or proposed roadway facilities in particular help alleviate severe and worsening congestion on i and i between alameda county and santa clara county support transportation solutions that will be instr u mental in maintaining the economic vitality and continuing development of silicon valley improve mobility options to employment education m edical and retail centers for corridor residents in particular lowincome youth elderly disabled and ethnic minority populations improve regional air quality by reducing auto emissi ons support local and regional land use plans and facili tate corridor cities efforts to direct business and residential investments in transit oriented development more efficient growth and sustainable development patterns are necessary to reduce impacts to the local and global environmental such as adverse climate change improved transit in the svrtc is consistent with the goals established in prior studies see section project history and responds to the longrange valley transportation plan vtp adopted by vta in february the primary goal of the longrange plan is to provide transportation facilities and services that support and enhance santa clara countys high quality of life and vibrant economy silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis purpose and need with a bart extension into santa clara county numerous opportunities would be available for transfers to destinations throughout the san francisco bay area and beyond there is a need for intermodal connections to existing and future services such as vtas light rail and buses throughout santa clara county caltrain to san francisco ace commuter rail to the central valley capitol intercity rail to sacramento amtrak interstate service to san diego and seattle washington the planned high speed rail service and a planned automated people mover apm to norman y mineta san jose international airport possibly most important given worker and travel demand associated with the continuing economic expansion of silicon valley is the rapid high capacity public transit access to alameda county and the greater east bay which extends to livermore in eastern alameda county and pittsburgh antioch in contra costa county commuters from the central valley would be able to use this transit system the reverse commute and general travel opportunities for svrtc residents is also important fremont is already more a part of silicon valley and its economy than the san franciscooakland metropolitan area with transit improvements santa clara county residents would be offered better access to jobs in fremont and points north and east the abag and mtc forecasts project expanding travel demand by santa clara county residents choosing to work outside the county limited travel options for low income and transit dependent populations based on us census data percent of the households in the svrtc do not have private transport compared with percent for santa clara county percent for alameda county and percent for the city of fremont see figure likewise percent of its households have incomes below the poverty level compared with percent for santa clara county percent for alameda county and percent for the city of fremont see figure lack of private transport which is highly correlated with low household income is a strong indicator of transit dependency these individuals rely on transit not just for trips to and from work but for social medical and recreational travel access to the proposed high speed high capacity bart extension would allow individuals traveling through the svrtc much faster access to their destinations compared to travel on bus or light rail lines the project has the potential to substantially benefit the mobility needs of these special user groups silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis purpose and need the svrtc population is only percent caucasian compared with percent for santa clara county and percent for both alameda county and the city of fremont indicating high percentages of minority groups see figure the largest minority or ethnic group is individuals of hispanic ancestry the svrtc and santa clara county have large populations of asian ancestry as well transit improvements would greatly benefit these populations by offering expanded travel options and facilitating economic development in their communities and providing additional travel options for populations accessing high concentrations of job centers within the svrtc see figure worsening air quality and excessive greenhouse gas emissions although the san francisco bay area has made great strides in improving air quality over the last few decades several problems remain the bay area air quality management district district covering the ninecounty bay area is in nonattainment relative to the federal hour and the state of california and hour standards for ozone a contributor to smog and respiratory problems the district is also in non attainment relative to the state standards for particulates both pm and pm particulate matter under and microns respectively which also can cause r espiratory problems santa clara county is the second worst region of the bay area for ozone and the worst for particulates mobile emissions are the primary source of these and other air pollutants in the svrtc with steadily increasing travel it will become more difficult to substantially improve air quality congestion and slowing travel speeds tend to worsen the problem because there is a direct relationship between vehicle miles traveled vmt travel speed and air pollution adding to the list of pollutants are greenhouse gas emissions most of which have not been previously monitored as part of federal and state air quality regulatory programs these include carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and refrigerants with co contributing the most to the greenhouse effect emissions of co are largely transportation related and proportional to vehicle miles of travel only by changing fuel types or reducing vmt will co emissions be reduced n eed for better land use developmentsmart growth promoting transit ridership requires more than providing a high level of service land use patterns must support use of transit densities along transit corridors must be relatively high nonhome destinations in particular must be concentrated and attractive for access by transitthat is easily walkable from transit stops or convenient by short shuttles land uses in silicon valley and the svrtc have been slowly changing to forms that would encourage greater transit and travel by nonauto modes but it is clear that development patterns must continue to change the svrtc cities of milpitas san jose and santa clara have established plans and policies that support transitoriented development particularly around planned transit stations improved transit in the svrtc would be consistent with these plans and policies see section land use elsewhere bart station areas have become silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis purpose and need nodes for higher density mixed commercial and housing development recent success stories on the fremont line that would be extended into santa clara county include the union city hayward and fruitvale stations improved transit is fully consistent with for example san joses redevelopment strategy for downtown improved transit to downtown would serve trips originating outside the area and santa clara county to reach new jobs and serve trips originating from new downtown housing planned downtown redevelopment with higher densities of housing officeresearch and retail is supportive of increased transit use improved transit would also allow further increases in land use densities enhancing both transit ridership and land use efficiency transit improvements present considerable opportunity to change the form of development along the svrtc despite leading to increased transit use compact development would allow growth to continue and not be limited by constraints on available land project history the alternatives are outcomes of various prior studies that have evaluated transportation needs in the svrtc and advanced a set of major capital improvements intended to expand transit service prior studies of note include the fremontsouth bay corridor final report commuter rail study fremontsouth bay corridor final report major investment study alternatives analysis misaa november t hese studies constitute a comprehensive systematic study of transportation conditions in the svrtc including existing and future need they also established transportation goals and objectives that would guide the development of transportation solutions that address identified needs the studies satisfied federal requirements for system and corridor level transportation needs assessment the mis served as a federal alternatives analysis of the various transportation investment options for the svrtc the mis focused on transit options that were consistent with the following goals goal congestion relief to reduce the level and extent of travel delay that is occurring on the corridor and regional highway system goal mobility improvements and regional connectivity to improve transit service to from and within the corridor by enhancing service quality comfort safety and reliability and quantity improved service frequencies travel times silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis purpose and need operating speeds and capacity to improve regional connections that ease transferring between systems by developing multimodal centers and by using multipleagency tickets and fares goal environmental benefits to provide transit improvements that enhance and preserve the social and physical environment and minimize potential negative impacts resulting from implementation of the transit alternatives goal transit supportive land use to ensure the compatibility of transportation improvements with local jurisdiction land use plans and policies so that transit ridership can be maximized and the number of auto trips reduced goal operating efficiencies to produce future resource savings for vta relative to existing and planned transit service improvements goal cost effectiveness to provide benefits from transportation improvements in relation to the costs goal local financial commitment to maintain vtas contribution to the cost of constructing operating and maintaining the preferred investment strategyrecommended project and the stability and reliability of its capital and operating funding sources for implementing the strategy goal community and stakeholder acceptance to provide a transportation system that reflects the needs and desires of the residents and businesses in the corridor is compatible with local planning initiatives and generates widespread political support goal environmental justice to provide an equitable amount of transit service and mobility benefits to transit dependent residents who are generally from low income or minority communities or households not having access to a private automobile goal safety and security to implement transit improvements without creating undue safety and security risks that cannot be mitigated goal construction impacts to minimize the extent and the duration of construction impacts on the surrounding community resulting from implementing transportation improvements eleven alternatives were identified that potentially addressed these goals and corridor needs they were analyzed for consistency in meeting goals and needs capital and operating costs possible environmental effects scan level detail and eight performance measures results of the mis were reviewed by the vta board of directors which on november approved a locally preferred alternative that would extend bart service through milpitas san jose and into santa clara
silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis environmental consequences socioeconomics table commercial vacancy rates for svrtc cities type of space low vacancy rate high vacancy rate office research and development manufacturing warehouse source colliers international this estimate of displacements is based on property utilization in the fall of the actual numbers and types of displacements could change prior to project implementation for purposes of presenting a conservative analysis properties or easements are assumed to be permanent acquisitions during final engineering vta may determine that some parcels can be leased during construction avoiding permanent displacement also the number of displacements property acquisitions and related relocations and easements required could change during final design and engineering as could the amount of land required from individual parcels estimates presented here are based on appendix b bep alternative plan and profiles appendix c svrtp alternative plan and profiles and appendix d station designs bep and svrtp alternatives federal and state laws require consistent and fair treatment of owners of property to be acquired including just compensation for their property these laws also require uniform and equitable treatment of displaced persons or businesses the provisions of vtas relocation program will minimize any adverse effects of the business and residential displacements associated with the bep or svrtp alternatives therefore no mitigation is required environmental justice findings a transportation project must consider potential effects to human health or the environment on a community composed of minority or lowincome populations adverse environmental effects related to environmental justice typically include physical hazards to people in environmental justice communities air quality effects increased noise and vibration contamination of soil or water division of a community or displacement the following discussion includes a discussion of effects of the svrtc alternatives on lowincome and minority populations to determine whether or not these are adverse and disproportionate in comparison with effects on other neighborhoods in the corridor silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis environmental consequences socioeconomics the population housing and employment information provided in section socioeconomics indicates that the study area contains a high percentage of minority residents as well as major retail areas and pockets of higher income areas in the city of milpitas implementation of the bep and svrtp alternatives would include direct mobility benefits that are expected to be equitably shared across communities by various demographic groups the discussion considers whether the alternatives would have disproportionate health and environmental effects on the high minority or low income neighborhoods identified as defined by executive order no federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and lowincome populations vta has conducted extensive public outreach including a comprehensive program to coordinate and communicate with these communities throughout the misaa eir seir and this environmental review process community members have provided substantive input into the current project design alignment choices station area planning and construction approach as discussed more fully in chapter agency and community participation no build alternative although the no build alternative may not adversely affect local communities it would not provide these communities with the benefits of accessibility to transit services as would the bep and svrtp alternatives regardless projects planned under the no build alternative would undergo separate environmental review to define whether ethnic minority or lowincome populations in project areas would experience disproportionately high adverse effects see section related projects for a list of future projects under the no build alternative bep alternative the geographic area of concern for the bep alternative includes areas adjacent to the proposed alignment and around the proposed milpitas and berryessa station areas these areas consist of vacant industrial and residential land uses which meet the environmental justice criteria the bep alternative alignment follows an existing rail corridor displacements substantially adverse hazards and traffic impacts would occur at several locations along the proposed alignment as described in more detail below the environmental justice study area location of lowincome and minority populations by census block and substantial adverse environmental effects relative to the bep alternative are shown on figure because the alignment is bordered by lowincome and minority communities the substantially adverse effects associated with the bep alternative would impact these communities all substantially adverse environmental effects would be mitigated where feasible ensuring that effects to lowincome and minority communities would not be substantially adverse the bep alternative would therefore not have disproportionate effects on minority or lowincome neighborhoods along the alignment silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis environmental consequences socioeconomics the types of effects on lowincome and minority populations and the mitigation that will be implemented to reduce these effects is discussed in more detail below overall neighborhoods and businesses along the alignment will benefit from the improved transit services for the surrounding area by providing more convenient access to regional rapid transit and improving connectivity to other transit services members of the community who may not have access to a private automobile or prefer to use transit will be better served with improved access to employment recreation shopping and public services facilities and other opportunities displacementrelocation under the bep alternative approximately to businesses one residential unit up to three community facilities flea market vendor stalls rental storage tenants up to three advertising signs and one cell phone tower would be displaced the locations of these displacements along the alignment are shown in figure although many of these displacements would occur in lowincome andor minority communities displacement and relocation activities would be conducted in accordance with the uniform act of and vtas relocation program as described in section this would minimize any adverse effects of the necessary property acquisition associated with the bep alternative upon lowincome and minority communities displacements necessary for construction staging areas and their affects on lowincome and minority communities are discussed in chapter air quality operation of the bep alternative would reduce the amount of air emissions generated in the region this benefit is directly related to a projected reduction in the number of vehicle miles traveled once the bart trains are operating since air quality effects of the bep alternative are beneficial adverse effects to lowincome or minority populations would not occur vehicular trips to bart stations would produce localized air emissions principally co in the station areas but the addition of these trips would not produce air emissions exceeding the federal or state ambient air quality standards as described in section air quality as a result localized air emissions would not result in a substantial adverse effect to lowincome or minority communities adverse effects related to air quality would occur during construction construction of the bep alternative would generate dust and other pollutant emissions associated with construction and earthmoving activities these potential effects will be reduced by actions outlined in chapter

below thresholds indicating potential health risks they would not result in a substantial adverse affect to lowincome or minority populations hazards as shown in figure contaminated soil and water is located in minority and low income communities along the alignment during operation of the bep alternative the potential for human exposure to existing contaminated soil would occur mainly during maintenance procedures including dewatering retained cut segments in accordance with best management practices any contaminated soil encountered during bart operations will be segregated from clean material covered while onsite to prevent dust generation or contaminated surface water runoff and properly disposed offsite in compliance with all pertinent rules and regulations furthermore as required by mitigation measure hm prior to construction of the bep alternative additional site specific information will be collected and documented regarding hazardous materials use and hazardous waste generation for properties that would be acquired for row or support facilities for inspections of properties that would be acquired as required by mitigation measure hm phase two site investigations will be completed for the acquired properties as necessary additionally to avoid the spread of harmful levels of contamination prior to starting regular discharges from each pump station the chemical content of the water will be tested and npdes permits or industrial wastewater discharge permits will be obtained and waste discharge requirements established in conclusion as a result of compliance with best management practices mitigation and applicable regulations bart maintenance procedures would not have a substantial adverse effect on minority or low income populations effects from construction period hazards and their proximity to lowincome and minority populations are discussed in chapter division of a community as discussed in section since the bep alternative is fully grade separated and located along an existing rail corridor it would not physically divide a community noisevibration the bep alternative would result in effects from noise and vibration generated by operation of the bart trains however as discussed in section no noise and vibration effects would be considered substantially adverse since substantially adverse noise and vibration effects would not occur lowincome or minority populations would not be adversely affected silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis environmental consequences socioeconomics noise and vibration construction activities and their relationship to environmental justice are discussed in chapter construction transportation and transit the bep alternative would reduce the number of vehicles on the roadways which would be a beneficial effect however this alternative would also contribute to traffic congestion on local streets and highways in bart station areas as discussed in chapter transportation and transit the location of these effects in relation to low income and minority communities are shown in figure fourteen intersections would experience adverse effects due to additional station traffic associated with the bep alternative these intersections are listed on pages and of the final eis in of these cases cost effective mitigation is not feasible given physical limitations at the intersections in addition to the affected intersections a total of four directional freeway segments in the vicinity of the berryessa station would be affected refer to chapter transportation and transit for additional discussion however in most cases where the mitigation is not feasible it is because the necessary improvements would be outside of the roadway row necessitating displacement of businessesresidencies and would require the demolition of major structures these adverse effects would affect traffic conditions in minority and lowincome communities as shown in figure fourteen out of intersections studied would be adversely affected and out of intersections affected would be mitigated feasible mitigation is not available for out of intersections adversely affected by the project since the bep alternative would also result in increased transit benefits in these same lowincome and minority communities overall the transportation effects to minority and lowincome communities would not be disproportionately high or adverse svrtp alternative the geographic area of concern for the svrtp alternative includes the area for the bep alternative and extends through downtown san jose via tunnel to santa clara displacements substantially adverse hazards and traffic impacts would occur at several locations along the proposed alignment as described below the environmental justice study area location of lowincome and minority populations by census tract and substantial adverse environmental effects relative to the svrtp alternative are shown in figure because the alignment travels through and is bordered by lowincome and minority communities the substantially adverse effects associated with the svrtp alternative would impact these communities all substantially adverse environmental effects would be mitigated where feasible ensuring that affects to lowincome and minority communities would not be substantially adverse the svrtp alternative would therefore not have disproportionate effects on minority or lowincome communities along the alignment silicon valley rapid transit corridor final eis environmental consequences socioeconomics conclusion the operational effects of the bep or svrtp alternatives on environmental justice communities can be mitigated as discussed previously although some traffic mitigation measures are deemed not practicable these mitigations combined with increased access to regional mass transit and reduction in air pollutant emissions will compensate for the adverse effects no disproportionately high and adverse effects on environmental justice communities would occur as a result of the bep or svrtp alternatives implementation of the bep or svrtp alternatives will enhance rather than adversely affect the integrated bus system light rail and roadway system
